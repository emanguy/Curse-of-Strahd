## Travel Mechanics

Travel mechanics are detailed in the PHB on **page 181**. There is a table which describes how many feet players can cover in minutes/hours/days.

**Players can only travel for 8 hours a day before risking exhaustion.**. Every hour past 8 hours, players must make a **DC 10 + # hours past 8** constitution saving throw. A failed save increases that character's exhaustion level by 1. Rules for exhaustion can be found on PHB **page 291**, and it should be noted that doing one long rest only removes one level of exhaustion.

To condense the travel rules a bit since the [[Barovia (Country)]] map has 1/4 mile hexes, the players travel at the following speeds on foot on roads:
* 3 minutes per hex at fast speed, but passive perception all has -5
* 4 minutes per hex at normal speed
* 6 minutes per hex at slow speed, but the characters can use stealth

In difficult terrain, such as the woods, movement speed is halved, resulting in the following:
* 6 minutes per hex at fast speed, but passive perception has -5
* 8 minutes per hex at normal speed
* 12 minutes per hex at slow speed, but characters can use stealth

## Common Barovia Features
* **Doors** - A door can be forced open with a **DC 10** strength check for normal doors or **DC 15** if it's barred/reinforced. Modifiers:
  * +5 DC if the door is made of stone
  * +10 DC if the door is made of iron
  * -5 DC if the door is made of glass or weakened
* **Secret doors** - Secret doors with obvious clues can be detected with a **DC 15** passive perception check, otherwise it requires an active perception check
* **Locks** - Locked doors require thieves' tools and a **DC 15** dex check. Smashing locks takes a **DC 20** strength check.
* **Webs** -
