## Travel Mechanics

Travel mechanics are detailed in the PHB on **page 181**. There is a table which describes how many feet players can cover in minutes/hours/days.

**Players can only travel for 8 hours a day before risking exhaustion.**. Every hour past 8 hours, players must make a **DC 10 + # hours past 8** constitution saving throw. A failed save increases that character's exhaustion level by 1. Rules for exhaustion can be found on PHB **page 291**, and it should be noted that doing one long rest only removes one level of exhaustion.

To condense the travel rules a bit since the [[Barovia (Country)]] map has 1/4 mile hexes, the players travel at the following speeds on foot:
* 3 minutes per hex at fast speed, but passive perception all has -5
* 4 minutes per hex at normal speed
* 6 minutes per hex at slow speed, but the characters can use stealth
