# Kragg's Musical Journey
## Story Beats
* Kragg is going to find a Cursed Lute along the path to the [[Tser Pool Encampment]]
  * It makes him play incredibly well but he cannot let go of it or remove it from his person
  * It also starts making him grow animal parts
    * Eventually if he does not figure out how to let go of this lute he will turn completely into a wolf and lose his humanity
    * Depending on how close he gets to the mad mage he will progress further and further in his transformation
  * The [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok]] may be able to help with the curse

## What's happened so far
* Kragg picked up the lute off the person of the shambling mound in the basement of the [[Haunted House]]
* Kragg played the lute a little on the Old Svalich Road and got tingly skin but nothing more has really happened yet
* Kragg realized he was growing a tail when he got to [[St. Andral's Church]]
