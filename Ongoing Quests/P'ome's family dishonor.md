# P'ome's Family Dishonor
## Story Beats
* P'ome's parents were dishonored by the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok]]
* When he invites them into his magnificent mansion, the party will notice several paintings on the wall labeled with names, titled "My Dear Brothers":
  * Bigby
  * Tenser
  * Otto
  * Rary
* There is also a window to the outside that somehow allows the party to view the top of Mount Baratok from above (again, it is a Butte)
* Mordenkainen also explains that prior to coming to defeat Strahd he used to create dungeons for adventurers and would experiment with various traps in his workshop just outside Waterdeep

### Explaining the spooking of his parents
* When explaining what happened to [[P'ome Gnossum]]'s parents, Mordenkainen will explain with this riff on "I like big butts and I cannot lie":
> I like big buttes and I cannot lie
> My other brothers can't deny
> That when a possum walks by with an itty bitty face
> And ya holding your trap in place
> 
> It gets sprung, you fly through the air
> 'cause that spring was taut as fuck
> possumfolk on the ground are staring
> I dunno how I'll be faring
> 
> Oh Talos, I'm gonna fall so hard / and break my mage shard
> Oh that ground is coming for me / and here it is
> may god have mercy, oof, bump on my head
> it looks like this possum's dead?
> Oh screw me, screw me, these folk look like they'll sue me
> 
> I'll get to fleein'; To hell with this scee-in (scene)
> Got bunches / of dungeons / more traps that I gotta set
> 
> I'm tired of being blamed
> 

The original:
> I like big butts and I can not lie  
> You other brothers can't deny  
> That when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty waist  
> And a round thing in your face  
> 
> You get sprung, wanna pull up tough  
'> Cuz you notice that butt was stuffed  
> Deep in the jeans she's wearing  
> I'm hooked and I can't stop staring  
> 
> Oh baby, I wanna get with ya / and take your picture  
> My homeboys tried to warn me / but that butt you got  
> Make me so horny, ooh, rumple smooth skin  
> You say you wanna get in my Benz  
> Well, use me use me 'cuz you ain't that average groupy  
> 
> I've seen them dancin', to hell with romancin'  
> She's sweat, / wet, / got it goin' like a turbo vette  
> 
> I'm tired of magazines, saying flat butts are the thing  
> Take the average black man and ask him that  
> She gotta pack much back  
> 
> So fellas, fellas, has your girlfriend got the butt?  
> (Yeah, yeah, hell, yeah)  
> Well shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it  
> Shake that healthy butt, baby got back

## What's happened so far
* P'ome heard that some magic user on the other side of [[Lake Zarovich]] is casting lightning magic, which matches what he remembers about the person who dishonored his parents
