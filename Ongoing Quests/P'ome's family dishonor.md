# P'ome's Family Dishonor
## Story Beats
* P'ome's parents were dishonored by the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok]]
* When he invites them into his magnificent mansion, the party will notice several paintings on the wall labeled with names, titled "My Dear Brothers":
  * Bigby
  * Tenser
  * Otto
  * Rary
* There is also a window to the outside that somehow allows the party to view the top of Mount Baratok from above (again, it is a Butte)
* Mordenkainen also explains that prior to coming to defeat Strahd he used to create dungeons for adventurers and would experiment with various traps in his workshop just outside Waterdeep

### Explaining the spooking of his parents
* When explaining what happened to [[P'ome Gnossum]]'s parents, Mordenkainen will explain with this riff on "I like big butts and I cannot lie":

> I like big buttes and I cannot lie
> My other brothers can't deny
> That when a possum walks by with an itty bitty face
> And ya holding your trap in place
> 
> It gets sprung, you fly through the air
> 'cause that spring was taut as fuck
> possumfolk on the ground are staring
> I dunno how I'll be faring
> 
> Oh Talos, I'm gonna fall so hard / and break my mage shard
> Oh that ground is coming for me / and so here it is
> may god have mercy, oof, bump on my head
> it looks like this possum's dead?
> Oh screw me, screw me, these folk look like they'll sue me
> 
> I'll get to fleein'; To hell with this scee-in (scene)
> Got bunches / of dungeons / more traps that I gotta set
> 
> I'm tired of being blamed
> For heroes harmed and maimed
> It's their choice to ven-ture out like that
> With dungeons that's a fact!
> 
> So P'ome! (yeah!) P'ome! (yeah!)
> Did I wanna hurt your mom? (Hell no!)
> I tell you I'm sorry! (Sorry!) I'm sorry! (Sorry!) I'd take it back if I could,
> Situation was whack!

## What's happened so far
* P'ome heard that some magic user on the other side of [[Lake Zarovich]] is casting lightning magic, which matches what he remembers about the person who dishonored his parents
