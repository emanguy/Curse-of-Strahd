# P'ome's Family Dishonor
## Story Beats
* P'ome's parents were dishonored by the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok]]
* When he invites them into his magnificent mansion, the party will notice several paintings on the wall labeled with names, titled "My Dear Brothers":
  * Bigby
  * Tenser
  * Otto
  * Raa

## What's happened so far
* P'ome heard that some magic user on the other side of [[Lake Zarovich]] is casting lightning magic, which matches what he remembers about the person who dishonored his parents
