# P'ome's Family Dishonor
## Story Beats
* P'ome's parents were dishonored by the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok]]
* When he invites them into his magnificent mansion, the party will notice several paintings on the wall labeled with names, titled "My Dear Brothers":
  * Bigby
  * Tenser
  * Otto
  * Rary
* There is also a window to the outside that somehow allows the party to view the top of Mount Baratok from above (again, it is a Butte)
* Mordenkainen also explains that prior to coming to defeat Strahd he used to create dungeons for adventurers and would experiment with various traps in his workshop just outside Waterdeep

### Explaining the spooking of his parents
* When explaining what happened to [[P'ome Gnossum]]'s parents, Mordenkainen will explain with this riff on "I like big butts and I cannot lie":
> I like big buttes and I cannot lie
> My other brothers can't deny
> That when a possum walks by with an itty bitty face
> And ya holding your trap in place
> 
> It gets sprung, you fly through the air

## What's happened so far
* P'ome heard that some magic user on the other side of [[Lake Zarovich]] is casting lightning magic, which matches what he remembers about the person who dishonored his parents
