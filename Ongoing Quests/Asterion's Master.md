# Asterion's Master

* When Asterion gets into the basement of the [[Haunted House]] he will start regaining memories in the following places:
  * The **Cult Initiates' Quarters** (Area 24) where he will remember waking up
  * Either of the two areas where the party can finally determine where the chanting is coming from, where Asterion will remember he was lead but can make a **DC 12 History Check** to determine he was being controlled by the ghost of Elizabeth Durst
  * In the **Dining Room** (Area 27) Asterion can find a shoulder plate with the symbol of Mystra on it among the bones
