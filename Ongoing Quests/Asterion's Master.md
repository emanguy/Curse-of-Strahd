# Asterion's Master
## Story Beats
* When Asterion gets into the basement of the [[Haunted House]] he will start regaining memories in the following places:
  * The **Cult Initiates' Quarters** (Area 24) where he will remember waking up
  * Either of the two areas where the party can finally determine where the chanting is coming from, where Asterion will remember he was lead but can make a **DC 12 History Check** to determine he was being controlled by the ghost of Elizabeth Durst
  * In the **Dining Room** (Area 27) Asterion can find a shoulder plate with the symbol of Mystra on it among the bones
  * In the **Cult Leaders' Den** (Area 33) Asterion can find a letter from the Vallaki branch of the cult where it managed to live on. It says the following:

> Grand Lord Master Durst,
>
> We have successfully set down in the nearby town of Vallaki. We shall continue to spread the promise of great hidden knowledge that our dark lord will surely bestow upon us as long as we continue our teachings. There are a great number of Barovians who wish to toss the yoke of this town's burgomaster as they have given up faith in him for our far greater purpose. We thank you for delivering the body of that strange armored heathen so we can plant our dark lord's seed in the hearts of the soulless here. We hope that you will soon visit to oversee our progress.
>
> He is the Ancient. He is the Land.
> He will surely come soon.
> - F.W.

* Asterion's master was originally an adventurer brought in by the [[Vistani]], and his death is what caused [[Strahd]] to come and destroy the [[Strahd Cult]] lurking at the death house

## What's happened so far
* Asterion acquired a recording of his master's death from the wizard [[Delfen]] in [[Daggerford]]
* After asking [[Father Donavich]] about the replica of the strange totem he found on his master's person he was pointed in the direction of the [[Haunted House]] as it has similar carvings and such in the area
