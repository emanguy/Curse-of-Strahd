# Ward's Bubble Gun
## Story Beats
* Ward wants to build a bubble gun which can shoot bubbles of holy water to combat the evils in the land of Barovia
* [[Gadof Blinksy]] says he's able to create a squirt gun for this purpose, but he'll need some materials first (tracked in Foundry document)
* When everyone returns [[Izek Strazni]] will be bullying [[Gadof Blinksy]] for another [[Ireena Kolyana]] doll
* The final squirt gun will have 15 charges of holy water at a range of 20/60, dealing 2d6 radiant damage on a successful hit
