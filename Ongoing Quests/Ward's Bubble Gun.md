# Ward's Bubble Gun
## Story Beats
* Ward wants to build a bubble gun which can shoot bubbles of holy water to combat the evils in the land of Barovia
* [[Gadof Blinksy]] says he's able to create a squirt gun for this purpose, but he'll need some materials first (tracked in Foundry document)
* When everyone returns [[Izek Strazni]] will be bullying [[Gadof Blinksy]] for another [[Ireena Kolyana]] doll
* The final squirt gun will have 15 charges of holy water at a range of 20/60, dealing 2d6 radiant damage on a successful hit as a normal ranged attack against fiends and undead
  * The squirt gun can be reloaded with a full waterskin's worth of holy water
* The squirt gun can be further upgraded to shoot holy water bubbles (which stay in place until the beginning of Ward's next turn) with the following items:
  * Metal o-ring
  * Blight needle
  * Bat fang
  * This upgrade will also require Ward to mix the holy water with lard during a reload to make it soapy and blow bubbles
## What's happened so far
* Ward has started collecting items for the squirt gun after speaking with Blinksy
