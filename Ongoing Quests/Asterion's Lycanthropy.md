# Asterion's Lycanthropy

## Story beats
* Asterion has lycanthropy and turns into an Eel Hound when he smells blood. To resist this transformation, he needs to beat a **DC 18 con save**. Transforming willingly will require a **charisma save** of the same DC to remain in control while transformed
* He can talk to [[Urwin Martikov]] about how he manages his lycanthropy, who will say that control over the transformation will come with time, and that it may be useful to converse with [[Mystra]] for guidance as well
* If he does this he will have a dream with Mystra during his next long rest where she will try to convince him that the lycanthropy may not be so bad after all
> After all, I am all magic -- whether you call it a curse or a blessing is a matter of perspective. By nature, magic is simply power granted to all of you through me, it is neither "good" nor "evil". Your lycanthropy, as you call it, is simply an alteration granted by the Weave which has granted you new abilities beyond that of a typical mortal. Simply recount your oath -- if you DISCIPLINE yourself, you can gain control over your transformation. By staying VIGILANT and asserting dominance over this magic, you can do good in the world and continue to be LOYAL to your friends.
* Mystra will also mention that she will assist in Asterion's conquest of the lycanthropy -- if he offers up lycanthrope blood to her she can alter the affects of the lycanthropy to have more control over himself after the transformation. **Every  vial of lycanthrope blood offered to Mystra will reduce the DC listed in the first bullet by 1. We'll roll a d4 per werewolf to see how many vials we get**
  * Alternatively, the same affect can be achieved by spending time meditating on the lycanthropy. **Every 2 long rests done while meditating on the lycanthropy will also reduce the DC by 2.**

## What's happened so far
* [[Asterion Tolger]] has resolved to speak with [[Urwin Martikov]] after the fight with the [[Dusk Elf Slavers]]
