# Asterion's Lycanthropy

## Story beats
* Asterion has lycanthropy and turns into an Eel Hound when he smells blood. To resist this transformation, he needs to beat a **DC 18 con save**.
* He can talk to [[Urwin Martikov]] about how he manages his lycanthropy, who will say that control over the transformation will come with time, and that it may be useful to converse with [[Mystra]] for guidance as well
* If he does this he will have a dream with Mystra during his next long rest where she will try to convince him that the lycanthropy may not be so bad after all
> After all, I am all magic -- whether you call it a curse or a blessing is a matter of perspective
