# Corvyn's Missing Parents
Names are **Tancryn and Isoti Folker**

## Story Beats
* Corvyn's parents were previously taken by the [[Vistani]] into the land of Barovia
* When they arrived they travelled to [[Vallaki]] and became were-ravens. They also joined the [[Keepers of the Feather]] to oppose [[Strahd]]
* When the party arrives in Vallaki, Tancryn and Isoti will not be there because they were sent out on an assignment
  * They have not been heard from in 3 weeks though...

## What's happened so far
* Parents were missing when the party arrived at [[Daggerford]]
* Found that Corvyn's parents previously travelled with the Vistani a week earlier via the guidebook the party signed at their camp
