# Reuniting with Bam's Fam
## Story Beats
* [[Bam Booty]] finds his brother after recognizing him through his dreams
* [[Wham Booty]] has been preparing to travel to find their parents, who are alive and have been captured by roving slavers, though he lost track of them
* The last place he saw them was somewhere off near [[Old Bonegrinder]] but he was chased off by the slavers before he could find out what happened to them
* [[Bam's Parents]] got in a fight with the slavers outside [[Old Bonegrinder]] and were seriously wounded.
  * A wereraven (a member of the [[Keepers of the Feather]]) had been there, sitting atop the Megaliths. It went to get help from other members and they managed to get them to [[Vallaki]]
* Bam's parents weren't looking good, and treatments weren't working when they arrived as they had been poisoned by the slavers' weapons
* There wasn't enough time to retrieve the antidote, so [[Urwin Martikov]] offered to turn them into were-ravens, as the mutation causes resistance to poison as a side effect
* Bam's parents then became members of the [[Keepers of the Feather]]. They then left on an assignment to spy on the [[Dusk Elf Slavers]] and haven't been heard from in 3 weeks.
  * They were captured in raven form and cannot revert to human form because they're being kept in a cage
* 

## What's happened so far
* Bam has been having recurring nightmares involving childhood memories with his parents
* When Bam reached [[Barovia Town]] and slept in the Blood of the Vine Tavern he had a modified version of the dream where he was playing with his toys with his brother.
  * He can determine it's [[Wham Booty]] almost through a sixth sense, like a tingling on the back of his neck
* The two brothers are traveling together now after they met up in [[Barovia Town]] and are on their way to [[Old Bonegrinder]] for the next chunk
