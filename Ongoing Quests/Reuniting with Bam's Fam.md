# Reuniting with Bam's Fam
## Story Beats
* [[Bam Booty]] finds his brother after recognizing him through his dreams
* [[Wham Booty]] has been preparing to travel to find their parents, who are alive and have been captured by roving slavers, though he lost track of them
* The last place he saw them was somewhere off near [[Old Bonegrinder]] but he was chased off by the slavers before he could find out what happened to them
* [[Bam's Parents]] got in a fight with the slavers outside [[Old Bonegrinder]] and were seriously wounded.
  * A wereraven (a member of the [[Keepers of the Feather]]) had been there, sitting atop the Megaliths. It went to get help from other members and they managed to get them to [[Vallaki]]
* Bam's parents weren't looking good, and treatments weren't working when they arrived as they had been poisoned by the slavers' weapons
* There wasn't enough time to retrieve the antidote, so [[Urwin Martikov]] offered to turn them into were-ravens, as the mutation causes resistance to poison as a side effect
* Bam's parents then became members of the [[Keepers of the Feather]]. They then left on an assignment to spy on the [[Dusk Elf Slavers]] and haven't been heard from in 3 weeks.
  * They were captured in raven form and cannot revert to human form because they're being kept in a cage
* Urwin will warn Bam that there's a ring of detection crystals surrounding the slavers' camp to warn them of intruders. 
  * It's possible to dislodge them but you'd need to be very careful about it - at least 2 must be dislodged from trees in the Svalich Woods in order to open up a sufficiently sized area to pass through undetected
  * It's also being patrolled by several members of the [[Dusk Elf Slavers]] who may show up while trying to dislodge the crystals. (They will appear if I roll a **5 or lower** on a pure luck roll)
  * There is another way - the slavers on patrol wear pendants with fragments of the same crystal used for the detection crystals. If you can steal one from them without being detected you could use it to get the party through
  * The patrolling slavers can set of an alert of intruders using the pendants though - it's effectively a concentration spell they can cast as an action which will activate if their concentration isn't broken by their next turn in a round of combat
* After the party makes it past the ring of detection crystals, they'll spot a small camp of **5 Drow  (Dusk Elf) Guards** with 2 **Bristled Moorbounders**. The guards are all shooting the shit, but one of them offends another, who throws a piece of his food at the other one. He misses wildly and the piece of food lands next to the party. This won't make the guards notice them, but the moorbounders will start heading for the food that was dropped so the party will need to figure their way out of that situation without getting caught
* The party will eventually arrive at the camp, where there will be a bunch of tents containing cages containing the creatures these dusk elves have enslaved. Around the camp are **15 Drow (Dusk Elf) Guards** who can all let creatures out of cages if they realize they are in danger. Their leader, [[Ranudia Telorel]], is speaking to 5 of them near one of the bonfires in the center of camp.
  * The party can try and find the tent where the ravens are, stealthily, but this will be difficult.
  * If the party gets into a fight with the slavers, if they make it into one of the tents I'll pull a set of beasts from a roll table that they set free in order to attack the party during the battle.

## What's happened so far
* Bam has been having recurring nightmares involving childhood memories with his parents
* When Bam reached [[Barovia Town]] and slept in the Blood of the Vine Tavern he had a modified version of the dream where he was playing with his toys with his brother.
  * He can determine it's [[Wham Booty]] almost through a sixth sense, like a tingling on the back of his neck
* The two brothers are traveling together now after they met up in [[Barovia Town]] and are on their way to [[Old Bonegrinder]] for the next chunk
