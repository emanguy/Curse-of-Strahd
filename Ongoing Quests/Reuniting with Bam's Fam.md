# Reuniting with Bam's Fam
## Story Beats
* Bam finds his brother after recognizing him through his dreams
* [[Wham Booty]] has been preparing to travel to find their parents, who are alive and have been captured by roving slavers, though he lost track of them
* The last place he saw them was somewhere off in 

## What's happened so far
* Bam has been having recurring nightmares involving childhood memories with his parents
* When Bam reached [[Barovia Town]] and slept in the Blood of the Vine Tavern he had a modified version of the dream where he was playing with his toys with his brother.
  * He can determine it's [[Wham Booty]] almost through a sixth sense, like a tingling on the back of his neck
