# Tser Pool Encampment
* Description for this area is on **page 36**.
* Camp for the [[Vistani]]
* The players can find out a little more about the origins of what I assume to be the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok]] from a Vistani woman at the campfire. The story she tells is on **page 36** also

## NPCs in the area
* 8 **draft horses** drinking from the river
* 12 vistani (**bandits**) around the fire telling stories and drinking wine
  * Intoxicated, have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks
*  3 sober vistani (**bandit captains**) are chilling on wagons
