# Tser Falls
Text to read if the players are coming from the [[Tser Pool Encampment]]:

> You follow the river to the base of a canyon, at the far end of which a great waterfall spills into a pool, billowing forth clouds of cold mist. A great stone bridge spans the canyon nearly one thousand feet overhead.

If they're coming from the main road:

> You follow the dirt road as it clings to the side of a mountain and ends before an arching bridge of mold encrusted stone that spans a natural chasm. Gargoyles cloaked in black moss perch on the corners of the bridge, their frowns weatherworn. On the mountainous side of the bridge, a waterfall spills into a misty pool nearly a thousand feet below. The pool feeds a river that meanders into the fog shrouded pines that blanket the valley.
