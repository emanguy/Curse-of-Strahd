# River Ivilis Crossroads
* Descriptions of this area can be found on **page 35**
* There's a gallows here that is initially empty
  * There are 11 graves around the gallows, which will only yield rotted coffins and moldy bones if they are dug up
* There's a sign with 3 arrows on it that point out the 3 directions the fork will take you
  * To the east: [[Barovia Town]]
  * To the northwest: [[Tser Pool Encampment]]
  * To the southwest: [[Castle Ravenloft]]/[[Vallaki]]

## Hanged Man
* A random character sees themselves hanging from the gallows, everyone else sees a random barovian
* It's just an illusion, so if it's touched or moved it just melts away and disappears
