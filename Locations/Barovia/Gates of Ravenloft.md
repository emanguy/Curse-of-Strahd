# Gates of Ravenloft
If the characters aren't in the carriage, tweak this text as necessary.

After winding through the forest and craggy mountain peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east, and the startling, awesome presence of Castle Ravenloft towers before you. The carriage comes to a dead stop before twin turrets of stone, broken from years of exposure. Befond these guard towers i the precipice of a fifty-foot-wide, fog-filled chasm that disappears into unknown depths.

A lowered drawbridge of old, shored up wooden beams stretches across the chasm, between you and the archway to the courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining under the weight. From atop the high walls, stone gargoyles stare at you out of their hollow eye sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden protcullis, green with growth, hangs above the entry tunnel. Beyond this location, the main doors of Ravenloft stand open. A rich, warm light spills from within, flodding the courtyard. Torches flutter sadly in sconces on both sides of the open doors.

* The wood on the drawbridge is old and can break, make a D100 check (5 or below) every time a creature other than Strahd or his horses steps on the bridge.
  * On a breaking board, the character makes a **DC 10 Dex Save** or they fall into the chasm 1000 feet below. A companion within 5 feet can grab the creature, giving them advantage on the save.
* There's a green slime on the ceiling of the portcullis tunnel which can be detected via a **DC 20 Perception check**. It will drop on the first character trying to leave through the portcullis tunnel.
