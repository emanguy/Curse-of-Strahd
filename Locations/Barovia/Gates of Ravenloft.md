# Gates of Ravenloft
If the characters aren't in the carriage, tweak this text as necessary.
```
After winding through the forest and craggy mountain peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east, and the startling, awesome presence of Castle Ravenloft towers before you. The carriage comes to a dead stop before twin turrets of stone, broken from years of exposure. Befond these guard towers i the precipice of a fifty-foot-wide, fog-filled chasm that disappears into unknown depths.
