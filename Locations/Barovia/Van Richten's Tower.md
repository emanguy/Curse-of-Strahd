# Van Richten's Tower
![[CurseofStrahd_VanRichtensTower_DM.jpg]]

## History
* A wizard named [[Khazan]] helped build [[Castle Ravenloft]] and retired to Lake Baratok where he built this tower
* The tower would have fallen if [[Khazan]] hadn't put up magic wards
* [[Rudolph van Richten]] found the tower and set up shop here, then went to live in [[Vallaki]]
* [[Esmerelda d'Avenir]] now lives here but isn't present when the characters arrive

## Approaching the Tower
> You come to a cold mountain lake enclosed by misty woods and rocky bluffs. Thick fog creeps across the dark, still waters. The trail ends at a grass-covered causeway that stretches a hundred yards across the lake to a flat, marshy island with a stone tower on it. The tower is old and decrepit, with collapsing scaffolds clinging to one side where a large gash has split the wall. Timeworn griffon statues, their wings and flanks covered with moss, perch atop buttresses that support the walls.

> Parked near the base of the tower, within sight of the entrance, is a barrel-topped wagon splattered with mud

* The tower is affected by a ward called **Khazan's Spell Drain** which acts as the spell _Antimagic Field_ centered on the tower and going out 5 feet from it in all directions
  * This doesn't affect magic spells, traps, or constructs that [[Khazan]] put together
