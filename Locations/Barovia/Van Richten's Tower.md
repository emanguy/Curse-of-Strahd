# Van Richten's Tower
![[CurseofStrahd_VanRichtensTower_DM.jpg]]

## History
* A wizard named [[Khazan]] helped build [[Castle Ravenloft]] and retired to Lake Baratok where he built this tower
* The tower would have fallen if [[Khazan]] hadn't put up magic wards
* [[Rudolph van Richten]] found the tower and set up shop here, then went to live in [[Vallaki]]
* [[Esmerelda d'Avenir]] now lives here but isn't present when the characters arrive

## Approaching the Tower
> You come to a cold mountain lake enclosed by misty woods and rocky bluffs. Thick fog creeps across the dark, still waters. The trail ends at a grass-covered causeway that stretches a hundred yards across the lake to a flat, marshy island with a stone tower on it. The tower is old and decrepit, with collapsing scaffolds clinging to one side where a large gash has split the wall. Timeworn griffon statues, their wings and flanks covered with moss, perch atop buttresses that support the walls.
> 
> Parked near the base of the tower, within sight of the entrance, is a barrel-topped wagon splattered with mud

* The tower is affected by a ward called **Khazan's Spell Drain** which acts as the spell _Antimagic Field_ centered on the tower and going out 5 feet from it in all directions
  * This doesn't affect magic spells, traps, or constructs that [[Khazan]] put together

## First Floor

### 1 - Ezmerelda's Magic Wagon
> Under layers of mud, this wagon sports a fresh coat of purple paint, and its wheels have fancy gold trim. A brass lantern hangs from each corner, and red drapes cover a tombstone-shaped window on each side. A steel padlock secures the back door, hanging from which is a cheap wooden sign that reads "Keep out!"

* Casting _Detect Magic_ on the wagon reveals it's radiating conjuration magic
* Casting _Identify_ on the wagon reveals the command word required to operate it: "Drovash"
  * This conjures a set of quasi-real draft horses magically tethered to the wagon
  * The horses can be dismissed with the command word "Arvesh"
* There's a trapdoor under the wagon which can be detected by looking under the wagon and succeeding on a **DC 13 Perception Check**. It's the only safe way inside the wagon
* The door on the wagon is booby trapped; when opened a flask of **Alchemist's Fire** falls from the ceiling and ignites hundreds of other flasks dangling from the walls inside
  * When the explosion goes off, creatures within 30 feet of the wagon make a **DC 12 Con save**, taking **10d10 fire damage** on a failure or half as much on a success
  * Creatures within 5 feet of the wagon have disadvantage on the saving throw
  * Setting off this trap destroys both the wagon and its contents
  * A character inside the wagon can disable the trap with a **DC 10 Dex check**, triggering the trap on a failure

> For more than three decades now, I have undertaken to investigate and expose creatures of darkness to the purifying light of truth and knowledge. "Hero" I am named in some circles; "sage" and "monster hunter" I am called in others. That i have survived countless supernatural assaults is seen as a marvel among my peers; my name is spoken with fear and loathing among my foes.
> 
> In truth, this "virtuous" calling began as an obsessive effort to destroy a vampire that murdered my child, and it has become for me a tedious and bleak career. Even as my life of hunting monsters began, I felt the weight of time in my weary shoulders. Today I am a man who has simply lived too long. Like a regretful lich, I find myself inexorably bound to an existence I sought out of madness and, seemingly, must now endure for all eternity. Of course I shall die, but whether I shall ever rest in my grave haunts my idle thoughts, and torments me in my dreams.
> 
> I expect that those who think me a hero will change their minds when they know the whole truth about my life as a hunter of the unnatural. Nevertheless, i must reveal, here and now, that I have been the indirect yet certain cause of many deaths, and the loss of many good friends. Mistake me not! I do not merely feel sorry for myself. Rather, I come to grips with a devastating realization: I now see that I am the object of a baleful Vistani curse. More tragically, the nature of this hex is such that I have not borne the brunt of it; instead, far worse, those who surround me have fallen victim to it!
> 
> I have related the tragic story of how my only child Erasmus was taken by Vistani and sold to a vampire. I explained how Erasmus was made a minion of the night stalker, and how it was my miserable part to free him from that fate at the point of a stake. What I have neglected to illuminate before is how I tracked Erasmus's kidnappers across the land, or how I "extracted" Erasmus's whereabouts form them.
> 
> In fact, the Vistani took Erasmus with my own, unwitting permission. They had brought an extremely ill member of their tribe to me one evening and insisted that I treat him, but I was unable to save the young man's life. In fear of their retribution, I begged the Vistani to take anything of mine if only they would withhold their terrifying powers, of which I knew nothing. To my lasting astonishment, they chose to surreptitiously take my son in exchange for their loss! By the time I realized what had occurred, they were already an hour gone.
> 
> Incensed beyond reason, I strapped the body of the dead young man to my horse and doggedly followed the Vistani caravan through the woods, naively allowing the sun to set before me without seeking shelter from the night. Shortly after darkness fell, I was beset by undead that would have slain me, had not their master -- a lich -- intervened and spared my life for reasons that I do not completely understand. He somehow detected me and with his powerful magic, took control of a pack of zombies that wandered in the forest. He spoke to me through the muscles of the dead things and placed a magic ward against undead on m, then animated the dead Vistana and bade it tell me where I could find its people. Unfortunately (I say in hindsight!), the plan worked. I found the child-stealers, and my unwelcome entourage included a groaning hoard of voracious undead that could not touch me, thanks to the lich's ward.
> 
> When I found the caravan, I threatened to set the zombies on the Vistani unless they returned my dear boy. They replied that he had been sold to the vampire, Baron Metus. Something inside me snapped. I released the zombies, and the entire tribe was eaten alive.
> 
> Yet the story has not ended. Before she died, the leader cursed me, saying "Live you always among monsters, and see everyone you love die beneath their claws!" Even now, so many years later, I can hear her words with painful clarity. A short time later, I found my dear Erasmus made into a vampire. He begged me to end his curse, which I did with a heavy heart. The darkness had torn him from my loving arms forever, and I foolishly believed that the curse had exacted its deadly toll. I wept until an insatiate desire for vengeance filled the bottomless rift in my heart.

### 2 - Tower Door
> The tower door is made of iron, with no visible handles or hinges. In the middle of the door is a large, embossed symbol - a connected series of lines with eight stick figures set around it. Carved into the lintel above the door is a word: **Khazan**.

* The door is magically locked and trapped. Attempting to touch the door without disabling the trap makes lightning envelop the tower and everything within 10 feet of it.
  * Players make a **DC 15 dex save** with disadvantage if wearing metal armor, taking **4d10 lightning damage** or half as much on a successful save.
  * The lightning lasts **10 minutes**, and any creature still in it at the start of their turn takes another **4d10 lightning damage**
* The 3rd time the trap is triggered, the magic on the tower fails and it collapses
  * Creatures inside the tower take **24d10 bludgeoning damage**
  * Creatures within 20 feet of the tower make a **DC 15 dex save**, taking **8d10 bludgeoning damage** from falling debris or none on a success
  * The collapse destroys nearly everything inside except the wooden chest from the 4th floor which takes **1d8 + 2 hours** to search through the rubble for
  * The clay golems from the 1st floor also live. There is a **10 percent chance of uncovering a golem** for every hour spent searching for the chest
* The door is opened by following the dance represented by the stick figures, following the line to each arm position in either direction
  * If the characters get an arm position wrong, a young blue dragon appears and attacks the party until it is reduced to 0HP or the characters successfully open the door
  * When the dance is done properly the door opens automatically and stays open for **10 minutes**
  * The door can be safely opened from inside, and stays open for **1 minute** when opened this way unless held open
* Beyond the door there's a 5-foot square vestibule with a curtain that conceals the first floor of the tower beyond 
  * After going inside, the tower door closes after **1 minute** unless held open
  * The tower door can be safely opened from inside

### 3 - Rickety Scaffolding
> Rotting wooden beams support the scaffolding, which groans and creaks with the slightest breeze. A series of ladders and platforms lead to a hole in the northwest wall on the third floor.

* The scaffolding can't support more than **200 pounds of weight**
  * If it collapses, anyone on it will fall 20 feet to the ground and take fall damage plus **2d6 piercing damage** from the debris
  * Creatures under the collapsing scaffolding must make a **DC 13 dex save** or take **4d6 bludgeoning damage** from the debris
