# Van Richten's Tower
![[CurseofStrahd_VanRichtensTower_DM.jpg]]

## History
* A wizard named [[Khazan]] helped build [[Castle Ravenloft]] and retired to Lake Baratok where he built this tower
* The tower would have fallen if [[Khazan]] hadn't put up magic wards
* [[Rudolph van Richten]] found the tower and set up shop here, then went to live in [[Vallaki]]
* [[Esmerelda d'Avenir]] now lives here but isn't present when the characters arrive

## Approaching the Tower
> You come to a cold mountain lake enclosed by misty woods and rocky bluffs. Thick fog creeps across the dark, still waters. The trail ends at a grass-covered causeway that stretches a hundred yards across the lake to a flat, marshy island with a stone tower on it. The tower is old and decrepit, with collapsing scaffolds clinging to one side where a large gash has split the wall. Timeworn griffon statues, their wings and flanks covered with moss, perch atop buttresses that support the walls.
> 
> Parked near the base of the tower, within sight of the entrance, is a barrel-topped wagon splattered with mud

* The tower is affected by a ward called **Khazan's Spell Drain** which acts as the spell _Antimagic Field_ centered on the tower and going out 5 feet from it in all directions
  * This doesn't affect magic spells, traps, or constructs that [[Khazan]] put together

## First Floor

### 1 - Ezmerelda's Magic Wagon
> Under layers of mud, this wagon sports a fresh coat of purple paint, and its wheels have fancy gold trim. A brass lantern hangs from each corner, and red drapes cover a tombstone-shaped window on each side. A steel padlock secures the back door, hanging from which is a cheap wooden sign that reads "Keep out!"

* Casting _Detect Magic_ on the wagon reveals it's radiating conjuration magic
* Casting _Identify_ on the wagon reveals the command word required to operate it: "Drovash"
  * This conjures a set of quasi-real draft horses magically tethered to the wagon
  * The horses can be dismissed with the command word "Arvesh"
* There's a trapdoor under the wagon which can be detected by looking under the wagon and succeeding on a **DC 13 Perception Check**. It's the only safe way inside the wagon
* The door on the wagon is booby trapped; when opened a flask of **Alchemist's Fire** falls from the ceiling and ignites hundreds of other flasks dangling from the walls inside
  * When the explosion goes off, creatures within 30 feet of the wagon make a **DC 12 Con save**, taking **10d10 fire damage** on a failure or half as much on a success
  * Creatures within 5 feet of the wagon have disadvantage on the saving throw
  * Setting off this trap destroys both the wagon and its contents
  * A character inside the wagon can disable the trap with a **DC 10 Dex check**, triggering the trap on a failure

> For more than three decades now, I have undertaken to investigate and expose creatures of darkness to the purifying light of truth and knowledge. "Hero" I am named in some circles; "sage" and "monster hunter" I am called in others. That i have survived countless supernatural assaults is seen as a marvel among my peers; my name is spoken with fear and loathing among my foes.
> 
> In truth, this "virtuous" calling began as an obsessive effort to destroy a vampire that murdered my child, and it has become for me a tedious and bleak career. Even as my life of hunting monsters began, I felt the weight of time in my weary shoulders. Today I am a man who has simply lived too long. Like a regretful lich, I find myself inexorably bound to an existence I sought out of madness and, seemingly
