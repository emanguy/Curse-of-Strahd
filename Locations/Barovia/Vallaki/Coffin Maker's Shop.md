# Coffin Maker's Shop
![[CurseofStrahd_CoffinMakersShop_DM.jpg]]
> This uninviting shop is two stories tall and has a sign shaped like a coffin above the front door. All of the window shutters are closed up tight, and a deathly silence surrounds the establishment.

* Owned by [[Henrik van der Voort]] (see more info on his situation on his page)
* The windows are latticed iron and frosted glass and are locked. The doors are  barred too.
* Hendrik says the shop is closed if the characters show up but won't resist if they break in. He'll also give up where **St. Andral's Bones** (Henrik's Bedroom) are as well as the **Vampire Nest**.
* If the characters report the incident to [[Vargas Vallakovich]] he'll dispatch 4 **guards** to arrest Hendrik and get the bones. Hendrik will only retrieve the bones himself if it's daytime.
  * He explains that the vampires forced him to steal the bones
