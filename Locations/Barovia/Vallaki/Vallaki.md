# Vallaki

> The Old Svalich Road meanders into a valley watched over by dark, brooding mountains to the north and south. The woods recede, revealing a sullen mountain burg surrounded by a wooden palisade. Thick fog presses up against this wall, as though looking for a way inside, hoping to catch the town aslumber.
> The dirt road ends at a set of sturdy iron gates with a pair of shadowy figures standing behind them. Planted in the ground and flanking the road outside the gates are a half-dozen pikes with wolves' heads impaled on them.

* Town is surrounded by a 15 foot high wall
* 3 Gates into town
  * North gate - "Zarovich Gate" - leads to [[Lake Zarovich]]
  * West gate - "Sunset Gate" - abandoned cottages outside
  * East gate - "Morning gate" - locals call it "Mourning gate"

## Defenses
* The gates are locked at night with padlocks and are **guarded by 2 guards**. They carry pikes instead of spears and can stab through the gates
  * **DC 20 Persuasion Check** to convince the guards to let you into the city at night
  * Town has **24 total guards**, half of whom are on duty at any given time
  * Town can also muster up a militia of 50 human **commoners**
