# Vistani Camp (Vallaki)

![[CurseofStrahd_VistaniCamp_DM.jpg]]

> The woods part to reveal an expansive clearing; a small, grass-covered hill with low houses built into its sides. Fog obscures the details, but you can see that these buildings feature elegantly carved woodwork and have decorative lanterns hanging from their sculpted eaves. Atop the hill, above the fog, is a ring of barrel-topped wagons that surround a large tent with a column of smoke pouring out through a hole in the top. The tent is brightly lit from within. Even at this distance, you can smell the odors of wine and horses that emanate from this central area.

* The camp has both [[Vistani]] and [[Dusk Elves]]
  * The Vistani here all serve [[Strahd]]
    * Dead elders, [[Luvash]] and [[Arrigal]] are now in charge
    * Actively looking for [[Arabelle]] who is missing
    * Also want wine because they ran out
  * The dusk elves had all their women killed by [[Strahd]] 4 centuries ago
    * They live in the small cottages lower on the hill
    * [[Kasimir Velikov]], [[Patrina Velikovna]]'s brother, lives here
    * Many of them looking for [[Arabelle]] too
    * Kept safe by the Vistani and don't want to get on Strahd's bad side

## Landmarks
### A - Kasimir's Hovel
> Standing quietly in front of this house, bathed in the warm light of its lanterns, are three sullen, gray-cloaked figures, their angular features and black, flowing hair half-hidden under their cowls.

* 3 figures mentioned above are **guards** (N male dusk elves) who direct characters inside
* Hovel has wooden statuettes of elven deities in cubbyholes along a wall and there's a tapestry of a forest too
* [[Kasimir Velikov]] can be found here
  * Says [[Patrina Velikovna]] is sending him dreams and that she's buried in the catacombs below [[Castle Ravenloft]]
    * Thinks she repented for her sins and wants to be free and brought back to life
  * If the characters seem like they wanna destroy [[Strahd]] he will tell them about [[The Amber Temple]] and that it might hold the key to destroying him
    * He wants to accompany the characters there to see if he can find something to bring his sister back to life

  * Arcane Lock
  * Compehend Languages
  * Hold Person
  * Identify
  * Locate object
  * Nondetection
  * Polymorph
  * Protection from evil and good
  * Wall of stone

### B - Dusk Elf Hovels
> A grim, gray-cloaked figure stands in front of the door to this house.

* The figure is a **guard** (N male dusk elf) who directs the party to [[Kasimir Velikov]]'s house
* Inside is the same as Kasimir's place but they're vacant because the elves are looking for [[Arabelle]]

### C - Vistani Tent
> Piled outside tho wagon are several empty casks of wine. From inside the tent comes the crack of a whip followed by the howls of a young man. Three sputtering campfires fill the tent with smoke, and through the haze you see six Vistani passed out in various places on the dead grass. A barely conscious and shirtless teenager hugs the central tent pole, his wrists bound with rope and his back streaked with blood. An older, larger man in studded leather armor lashes the young man with a horsewhip, causing him to scream again. Standing in the bigger man's shadow is a third man also clad in studded leather. "Easy, brother," he says to the whip-wielding brute. "I think Alexei has learned his lesson."

* The two [[Vistani]] in studded leather armor are [[Luvash]] and [[Arrigal]], **bandit captains**, CE and NE respectively who are the camp leaders
  * Each of them carries a key to the treasure wagon (see below)
  * [[Luvash]] is overjoyed if [[Arabelle]] is returned and allows the party to pick an item from the treasure wagon (see below)
  * If the characters ask a favor from them they won't cooperate until the party either brings them [[Arabelle]] or 6 barrels of wine, recommending they get the barrels in either [[Vallaki]] or [[The Wizard of Wines]] refinery
  * [[Arrigal]] will try to steal items that could be useful or damaging to [[Strahd]] if he hears the characters have one on them, going so far as killing the characters if necessary
    * If he succeeds he takes one of the horses (see below) and rides it to [[Castle Ravenloft]] to deliver it to [[Strahd]]
* [[Luvash]] is punishing [[Alexei]] (CN male human **bandit** with 3HP) who failed to keep a watchful eye on [[Arabelle]]
  * He's accepted the punishment and tells the characters not to free him if they try, not wanting to look weak in front of the two Vistani
* There are also 6 conked out Vistani (CN human **bandits**) on the floor who only wake up if they take at least 5HP of damage
* 12 vistani **bandits** are missing from the camp who are searching for [[Arabelle]]
  * Every hour, **1d4 of them return** with no new news about her
  * 9 of them appear within 2 rounds if the alarm is sounded for whatever reason

### D - Horses
>  The hilltop is covered with steaming piles of horse dung. More than two dozen horses are tethered to stone blocks inside the circle of wagons but outside the tent. Most of the animals are draft horses, but a few of them are riding horses equipped with saddles.

* There are 24 **draft horses** and 6 **riding horses** here

### E - Luvash's Wagon
> This barrel-topped wagon is nicer than the others. Drapes of golden silk hang in the windows, and the wheels have gold, sun-shaped hubcaps. An iron chimney pipe protrudes from the roof.

* It's a mess inside: wineskins everywhere, dirty clothes, think freshman college dorm room
* There's a burlap doll on the ground, [[Arabelle]]'s only possession
* An iron stove inside keeps everything warm
