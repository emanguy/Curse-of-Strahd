# Vistani Camp (Vallaki)

![[CurseofStrahd_VistaniCamp_DM.jpg]]

> The woods part to reveal an expansive clearing; a small, grass-covered hill with low houses built into its sides. Fog obscures the details, but you can see that these buildings feature elegantly carved woodwork and have decorative lanterns hanging from their sculpted eaves. Atop the hill, above the fog, is a ring of barrel-topped wagons that surround a large tent with a column of smoke pouring out through a hole in the top. The tent is brightly lit from within. Even at this distance, you can smell the odors of wine and horses that emanate from this central area.

* The camp has both [[Vistani]] and [[Dusk Elves]]
  * The Vistani here all serve [[Strahd]]
    * Dead elders, [[Luvash]] and [[Arrigal]] are now in charge
    * Actively looking for [[Arabelle]] who is missing
    * Also want wine because they ran out
  * The dusk elves had all their women killed by [[Strahd]] 4 centuries ago
    * They live in the small cottages lower on the hill
    * Many of them looking for [[Arabelle]] too
    * Kept safe by the Vistani and don't want to get on Strahd's bad side
