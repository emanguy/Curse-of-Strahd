# Lady Wachter's Wish
* [[Ernst Larnak]] shadows the characters, detected by a **DC 14 passive perception** check
  * If confronted, he says he "keeps a watchful eye on all strangers"
  * If threatened, he backs off and reports to [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] if he thinks he's not being pursued or watched
* [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] is looking for allies to take down [[Vargas Vallakovich]], if [[Ernst Larnak]] thinks the party fits the bill he or [[Nikolai and Karl Wachter]] will be sent to invite the party over for dinner
* During dinner she invites the players to work with her to overthrow the baron. See her page for more info.
  * If the players refuse she marks them as her enemies and sets out to destroy them

## Consequences
* When [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] determines the party are her enemies, she sends [[Ernst Larnak]] to the [[Vistani Camp (Vallaki)]] with a bag of **100gp** with a letter saying they should kill the party when they leave town
  * The Vistani burn the letter after reading it
* If the players rescued [[Arabelle]], the Vistani return the gold and do nothing
* If not, a **vistana bandit** watches the road east of [[Vallaki]]. They think the characters might be too much of a match for them, so they send an emissary on horseback to inform [[Strahd]]. If [[Arrigal]] is alive
