# Lady Wachter's Wish
* [[Ernst Larnak]] shadows the characters, detected by a **DC 14 passive perception** check
  * If confronted, he says he "keeps a watchful eye on all strangers"
  * If threatened, he backs off and reports to [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] if he thinks he's not being pursued or watched
* [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] is looking for allies to take down [[Vargas Vallakovich]], if [[Ernst Larnak]] thinks the party fits the bill he or [[Nikolai and Karl Wachter]] will be sent to invite the party over for dinner
* During dinner she invites the players to work with her to overthrow the baron
