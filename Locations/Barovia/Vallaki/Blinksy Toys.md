# Blinksy Toys

> This cramped shop has a dark entrance portico, above which hangs a wooden sign shaped like a rocking horse, with a "B" engraved on both sides. Flanking the entrance are two arched, lead-framed windows. Through the dirty glass, you see jumbled displays of toys and hanging placards bearing the slogan "Is no fun, is no blinksy!"

## History
* The most recent customer to the shop was [[Rudolph van Richten]] who bought a vistana toy
  * Realizing [[Gadof Blinksy]] was lonely, he gave him his pet monkey (use **Baboon** stats for the monkey)
* Business is not good since Blinksy makes creepy toys, but [[Vargas Vallakovich]] keeps him employed by giving him money to make festival decorations
  * Blinksy has been teaching the monkey to fetch toys for him from high shelves
* Blinksy recites the following when greeting new customers:

> Wyelcome, friends, to the House of Blinksy, where hyappiness and smiles can be bought at bargain prices. Perhaps you know a leetle child in need of joy? a leetle toy for a girl or boy?

## Creepy toys in the shop
* Everything in the shop is **9cp**. Here are some notable things on the shelves:
  * A headless doll with a sack of attachable heads, including one with its eyes and mouth stitched shut
  * A miniature gallows, complete with trapdoor and weighted "hangman" 
  * A set of wooden nesting dolls which get older as they get smaller until the center one is a mummified corpse
  * A wood and string mobile with hanging bats that flap their wings
  * A wind-up musical merry-go-round with wolves that chase children instead of horses
  * A ventriloquist dummy that looks like Strahd
  * A doll that looks a lot like [[Ireena Kolyana]]
    * Blinksy just reports that he makes these for [[Izek Strazni]] who threatens to burn down his shop if he doesn't get a new one each month
    * Blinksy will put 2 and 2 together if Ireena is with the party

## Blinksy's Request
* Blinksy will mention to the party that he's a student of [[Fritz van Weerg]] and that he hears one of van Weerg's greatest masterpieces, a clockwork man, is somewhere in [[Castle Ravenloft]]. 
  * He asks the party to retrieve it if they ever come across it, but since business isn't going well all he has to offer them for it is a toy of his, or his monkey if they don't want the toy
