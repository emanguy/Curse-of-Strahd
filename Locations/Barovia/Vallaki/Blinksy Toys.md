# Blinksy Toys

> This crampeid shop has a dark entrance portico, above which hangs a wooden sighn shaped like a rocking horse, with a "B" engraved on both sides. Flanking the entrance are two arched, lead-framed windows. Through the dirty glass, you see jumbled displays of toys and hanging placards bearing the slogan "Is no fun, is no blinksy!"

## History
* The most recent customer to the shop was [[Rudolph van Richten]] who bought a vistana toy
  * Realizing [[Gadof Blinksy]] was lonely, he gave him his pet monkey (use **Baboon** stats for the monkey)
* Business is not good since Blinksy makes creepy toys, but [[Vargas Vallakovich]] keeps him employed by giving him money to make festival decorations
  * Blinksy has been teaching the monkey to fetch toys for him from high shelves
* Blinksy recites the following when greeting new customers:

> Wyelcome, friends, to the House of Blinksy, where hyappiness and smiles can be bought at bargain prices. Perhaps you know a leetle child in need of joy? a leetle toy for a girl or boy?
