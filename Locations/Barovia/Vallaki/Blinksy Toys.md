# Blinksy Toys

> This crampeid shop has a dark entrance portico, above which hangs a wooden sighn shaped like a rocking horse, with a "B" engraved on both sides. Flanking the entrance are two arched, lead-framed windows. Through the dirty glass, you see jumbled displays of toys and hanging placards bearing the slogan "Is no fun, is no blinksy!"
