# The Festival of the Blazing Sun

**Normally takes place 3 days after the characters arrive in town**

> Under threatening skies, a parade of unhappy children dressed as flowers trudges through the muddy streets, leading the way for a group of sorry-looking men and women carrying a 10-foot diameter wicker ball. The burgomaster and his smiling wife, who holds a sad bouquet of wilting flowers, follow the procession on horseback. As weary spectators watch from their stoops, the ball is borne to the town square. There, it is hoisted and hung from a fifteen-foot-high wooden scaffold, and townsfolk take turns splashing it with oil. Before the wicker sun can be set ablaze, the sky tears open in a sudden downpour. "All will be well!" cries the burgomaster as he brandishes a sputtering torch and marches defiantly through the rain toward the wicker ball, only to have his torch go out as he thrusts it into the sphere.
> 
> A singular laugh erupts from the crowd, drawing the burgomaster's fiery gaze as well as gasps from the townsfolk.

* [[Lars Kjurls]], a LG human **guard** is the one who laughed and [[Vargas Vallakovich]] has him arrested for "spite"
  * Unless the party stops him, he is bound and dragged behind Vargas's horse "for the amusement of all"

## Consequences

* If the characters challenge Vargas he has them banished from [[Vallaki]]
  * If they protest, he orders the guards to arrest them, take their weapons, and throw them out at swordpoint
  * If they manage to fend off the guards somehow Vargas retreats with them to the [[Burgomaster's Mansion (Vallaki)]], the characters have free rein of the town, and the townsfolk flee to their homes
* The players have actually managed to get the townsfolk to throw Vargas out of Vallaki. Here's what happens as a result of that:
  * The townsfolk are now referring to the party as **The Warriors of the Azure Sun** and have a degree of respect for them
  * The townsfolk are now rioting around the Burgomaster's mansion and are trying to break down the door
  * If the party goes near [[St. Andral's Church]], they'll see [[Izek Strazni]] is tromping towards it with a group of guards. [[Strahd]] has tipped him off about [[Ireena Kolyana]] and is trying to use him to get her out in the open.
    * If he successfully manages to get Ireena out, a **Vampire Spawn** that Strahd broke out of the [[Coffin Maker's Shop]] and 3 **Ghouls** will attempt to take her through the Sunset Gate. If they successfully move ahead for 3 consecutive rounds while grappling Ireena they will capture her successfully.
