# St. Andral's Feast
**This event will not happen if the characters manage to kill the Vampire Spawn in the [[Coffin Maker's Shop]] or if they return St. Andral's bones to the church**

* This event occurs **3 days after the characters arrive in town**.
* [[Strahd]] visits the [[Coffin Maker's Shop]] and orders the **vampire spawn** there to attack [[St. Andral's Church]] along with 4 **swarms of bats**
  * The bats terrify the congregation
  * The vampire spawn cling to the outside of the church and attack anyone running out of it
* Eventually [[Strahd]] enters the church in bat form, then becomes a vampire and tries to kill [[Lucian Petrovich]]
  * If he does this successfully, the townsfolk bury the body behind the church and he rises again as a vampire spawn the following night
  * If [[Rudolph van Richten]] learns about Lucian's death, he recommends that his body should be burned so his body doesn't rise from the dead

## Consequences

### The players fail to stop the attack
* The father's death demoralizes the townsfolk, so in a few days the townsfolk will set [[Vargas Vallakovich]]'s mansion ablaze and they stone him and his family in the street
* [[Izek Strazni]] flees and hides to avoid the people's wrath (where he goes is up to me)

### The players stop the attack
* [[Strahd]] visits [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] and writes "Strahd's Invitation", inviting the characters to [[Castle Ravenloft]] 
  * She delivers it to the characters via [[Nikolai and Karl Wachter]] or her spy, [[Ernst Larnak]]
  * The characters get no random encounters on the way to the castle if they accept the invitation
