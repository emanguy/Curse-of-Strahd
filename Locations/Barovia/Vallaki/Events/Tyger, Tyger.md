# Tyger, Tyger

   * [[Karl Wachter]] and [[Nikolai Wachter]] get drunk and one dares the other to shake the wagon at [[Arasek Stockyard]]
   * The saber tooth tiger gets mad and breaks out. Everyone in town hears the Wachters scream
   * There are reports going around that there's a tiger loose in the streets
     * [[Izek Strazni]] gets 6 **guards** together and hunts down the beast, hoping to find and kill it
     * [[Rudolph van Richten]] tries to lure the beast back into its wagon, telling people it won't harm them

## Consequences
* [[Vargas Vallakovich]] does an investigation into the source of the tiger
  * The Wachters lie and say they were at the festival
  * [[Gunther Arasek]] and [[Yelena Arasek]] say they heard "evil growls" and scratching sounds coming from van Richten's cart at [[Arasek Stockyard]], then say they saw the cart's owner dropping food into the wagon through the hole in the roof
* Once he learns [[Rudolph van Richten]] owned the cart, the Burgomaster orders that Rudolph should be arrested
  * If van Richten thinks the party can help him, he asks them to distract Vargas and his guards so he can escape with [[Drusilla]], his wagon, and his tiger
  * If asked where he's going, he tells the characters that he's going to "an old tower to the west where I can lay low" ([[Van Richten's Tower]])
