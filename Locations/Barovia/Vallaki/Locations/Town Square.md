# Town Square
> The shops and homes that enclose the town square are decorated with limp, tattered garlands and painted wooden boxes filled with tiny, dead flowers. At the north end of the square stands a row of stocks, locked in which are several men, women, and children wearing crude, plaster donkey heads.
> 
> In the center of the square, peasants in patchwork clothes eye you suspiciously as they use cups and vase to draw water from a crumbling stone fountain. Standing tall at the center of the fountain is a gray statue of and impressive man facing west. All around the square are posted proclamations:
> 
> Come one, come all,
> to the greatest celebration of the year:
> THE WOLF'S HEAD JAMBOREE!
> Attendance and children required.
> Pikes will be provided.
> ALL WILL BE WELL!
> -- The Baron --

* The [[Wolf's Head Jamboree]] already happened so the poster is old
* If the characters stick around for a while, [[Izek Strazni]] arrives with 2 **guards** and orders them to replace the posters with the following:

> COME ONE, COME ALL!
> to the greatest celebration of the year:
> THE FESTIVAL OF THE BLAZING SUN!
> Attendance and children required.
> Rain or shine.
> ALL WILL BE WELL!
>  -- The Baron --

* The townsfolk don't recognize the statue in the center, but [[Vargas Vallakovich]] claims it's the founder of [[Vallaki]], [[Boris Vallakovich]] (there's not much resemblance)
