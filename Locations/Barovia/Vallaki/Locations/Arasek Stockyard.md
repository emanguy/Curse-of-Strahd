# Arasek Stockyard
> This large stockyard has several locked sheds along its periphery and lies adjacent to a roomy warehouse. A wooden sign above the front gate reads "Arasek Stockyard".
> 
> Parked at the south end of the stockyard is a sturdy carnival wagon, its colorful paint peeling off. Faded lettering on its sides spell out the words "Rictavio's Carnival of Wonders." A heavy padlock secures the back door.

* General store owned by [[Gunther Arasek]] and [[Yelena Arasek]] (LG human commoners)
  * Sell items from the PHB's Adventuring Gear table (PHB 148) that are worth 25 gp or less **at 5x the price**.
* Also has a facility where people can rent storage shacks.

## Rictavio's Carnival Wagon
* [[Rudolph van Richten]] paid Gunther and Yelena a bunch of money to watch this wagon, no questions asked
* Read the following when the characters approach the wagon:
> The wagon suddenly lurches, as though something big has thrown itself against the inside wall. You hear the cracking of wood, the scraping of metal, and the snarl of something inhuman. Upon closer inspection, you see that the sides of the wagon are spattered with dry blood. You also see an inscription on the wagon's door frame that reads "I bring you from Shadow into Light!""

* [[Rudolph van Richten]] has the key to the lock on the door, and the lock is rigged with a poison dart trap if picked
  * **DC 15 Perception** to detect it
  * **DC 15 Investigation** to find the holes where the darts launch, which can be plugged
  * When activated, the trap makes four **+8 ranged attacks** against the person picking the lock, causing **1d4 piercing damage**. They must also make a **DC 15 Con Save**, taking **2d10 poison damage** on a failed save and half as much on a success
* There's a **saber toothed tiger** inside with **84 HP**
  * It has armor too, making its AC 17
  * It doesn't attack anyone unless it's in self defense or if it sees a [[Vistani]]
* [[Rudolph van Richten]] regularly feeds it through a hole in the top of the wagon
* There's a torn up doll inside the wagon as well
  * A **DC 10 Investigation** check shows that the doll was an effigy of a [[Vistani]] which has a tag on it saying "Is no fun, is no Blinksy!"

## Treasure
