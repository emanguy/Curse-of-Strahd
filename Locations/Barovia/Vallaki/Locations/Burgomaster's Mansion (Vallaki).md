# Burgomaster's Mansion (Vallaki)
![[CurseofStrahd_BurgomastersMansion_DM.jpg]]
> This mansion has walls of plastered stone that display many scars where the plaster has fallen away from age and neglect. Drapes cover every window, including a large, arched opening above the mansion's double entrance doors.

## Regular Happenings
* Guards bring in people accused of "malicious unhappiness"
* Commoners are bringing in bundles of sticks for [[The Festival of the Blazing Sun]]

## Other Happenings
* 2 members of the staff have vanished recently and [[Vargas Vallakovich]] told [[Izek Strazni]] to find them
  * These are the **butler** and [[Lydia Petrovna]]'s **lady-in-waiting**
  * See Victor's Workroom, area T for more on this

## Areas - Ground Floor
### A - Entrance Hall and Vestibule
> Framed portraits adorn the walls of this grand foyer, which features a wide staircase with a sculpted railing. A long, carpeted hall attached to the foyer stretches almost the length of the mansion and has several doors leading away from it, including one at the far end. Bundles of twigs are heaped against the walls.
* If the characters knock on the door here, a maid (LG female human **commoner**) lets them in, takes them to the Den (area E), and fetches [[Vargas Vallakovich]]
* The portraits here depict [[Vargas Vallakovich]], his family, and their ancestors
  * Looking closely, one may notice that some of the ancestors look nearly alike
* There's a vestibule here packed with cloaks, coats, and boots

### B - Parlor
> This parlor contains a fine array of furnishings and draperies, with an overall feminine touch.

* [[Lydia Petrovna]] entertains guests here

### C - Dining Room
* Characters hear female voices in here
> A chandelier of wrought iron fitted with wax candles hangs above a polished wooden dining table. Around the table are seated eight women of various ages in comfortable, high-backed chairs. They wear faded clothes, drink tea, and devour cake while a ninth woman, well dressed and very pleased with herself, circles the table and talks excitedly about decorations for the impending festival.

* Women are 8 vallakian peasants (**commoners**) while [[Lydia Petrovna]] circles the table
  * They're just here to get some grub
  * Lydia has them here to sew together children's costumes and weave a wicker sun for [[The Festival of the Blazing Sun]]
* When Lydia sees the characters walk in she assumes they were invited by [[Vargas Vallakovich]] and sends them to the Den (area E) then tells a maid to go fetch him from the Library (area L)

### D - Preparation Room
> White sheets cover two plain wooden tables in the center of this room. Neatly arranged atop one table is a complete set of polished silverware. The other table is covered with wicker baskets containing turnips and beets.

* The beets and turnips are for [[The Festival of the Blazing Sun]]

#### Treasure
* The silverware set is worth **150gp**

### E - Den
> Padded chairs and couches line the walls of this cozy, carpeted den. The room reeks of pipe smoke, and mounted on the east wall is the head of an angry-looking brown bear.

* The bear's head is supposed to unnerve visitors
  * [[Vargas Vallakovich]] claims his father killed the bear but it was actually gifted to his family by [[Szoldar Grygorovich]], who was the father of [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]]

### F - Servants' Quarters
> This room contains four simple beds and an equal number of plain wooden trunks.
* Household staff all live here, they are:
  * A maid (LG female **commoner**)
  * A cook (LG male **commoner**)
  * The butler
  * The baroness's lady-in-waiting
* The chests here just contain the staff's clothes and uniforms

### G - Kitchen
> A cook wearing a white apron over a black smock busies himself in this warm, well-appointed kitchen. A staircase in one corner climbs to the upper floor.
* The door to the garden to the west is locked but the cook and [[Vargas Vallakovich]] have keys to it

### H - Pantry
> This pantry contains shelves of foodstuffs, although half of the shelves are bare. Two barrels of wine stand against the east wall.

* Two barrels of wine are labeled with [[The Wizard of Wines]] logo and contain Red Dragon Crush

## Areas - Upper Floor
### I - Upstairs Gallery
* Arriving from the entrance (area A): 
> The staircase climbs twenty feet to a beautifully appointed gallery that continues toward the west, running almost the length of the mansion. Framed landscape paintings line the walls, and red silk drapes cover a ten-foot-tall arched window of leaded glass.

* Arriving from the kitchen (area G):
> The staircase climbs to a ten-foot-wide gallery that stretches almost the length of the mansion. Breathtaking paintings of landscapes line the walls. Two separate, narrow hallways lead away from the gallery to the north.
