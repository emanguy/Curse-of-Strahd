# Burgomaster's Mansion (Vallaki)
![[CurseofStrahd_BurgomastersMansion_DM.jpg]]
> This mansion has walls of plastered stone that display many scars where the plaster has fallen away from age and neglect. Drapes cover every window, including a large, arched opening above the mansion's double entrance doors.

## Regular Happenings
* Guards bring in people accused of "malicious unhappiness"
* Commoners are bringing in bundles of sticks for [[The Festival of the Blazing Sun]]

## Other Happenings
* 2 members of the staff have vanished recently and [[Vargas Vallakovich]] told [[Izek Strazni]] to find them
  * These are the **butler** and [[Lydia Petrovna]]'s **lady-in-waiting**
  * See Victor's Workroom, area T for more on this

## Areas - Ground Floor
### A - Entrance Hall and Vestibule
> Framed portraits adorn the walls of this grand foyer, which features a wide staircase with a sculpted railing. A long, carpeted hall attached to the foyer stretches almost the length of the mansion and has several doors leading away from it, including one at the far end. Bundles of twigs are heaped against the walls.
* If the characters knock on the door here, a maid (LG female human **commoner**) lets them in, takes them to the Den (area E), and fetches [[Vargas Vallakovich]]
* The portraits here depict [[Vargas Vallakovich]], his family, and their ancestors
  * Looking closely, one may notice that some of the ancestors look nearly alike
* There's a vestibule here packed with cloaks, coats, and boots

### B - Parlor
> This parlor contains a fine array of furnishings and draperies, with an overall feminine touch.

* [[Lydia Petrovna]] entertains guests here

### C - Dining Room
* Characters hear female voices in here
> A chandelier of wrought iron fitted with wax candles hangs above a polished wooden dining table. Around the table are seated eight women of various ages in comfortable, high-backed chairs. They wear faded clothes, drink tea, and devour cake while a ninth woman, well dressed and very pleased with herself, circles the table and talks excitedly about decorations for the impending festival.

* Women are 8 vallakian peasants (**commoners**) while [[Lydia Petrovna]] circles the table
  * They're just here to get some grub
  * Lydia has them here to sew together children's costumes and weave a wicker sun for [[The Festival of the Blazing Sun]]
* When Lydia sees the characters walk in she assumes they were invited by [[Vargas Vallakovich]] and sends them to the Den (area E) then tells a maid to go fetch him from the Library (area L)

### D - Preparation Room
> White sheets cover two plain wooden tables in the center of this room. Neatly arranged atop one table is a complete set of polished silverware. The other table is covered with wicker baskets containing turnips and beets.

* The beets and turnips are for [[The Festival of the Blazing Sun]]

#### Treasure
* The silverware set is worth **150gp**

### E - Den
> Padded chairs and couches line the walls of this cozy, carpeted den. The room reeks of pipe smoke, and mounted on the east wall is the head of an angry-looking brown bear.

* The bear's head is supposed to unnerve visitors
  * [[Vargas Vallakovich]] claims his father killed the bear but it was actually gifted to his family by [[Szoldar Grygorovich]], who was the father of [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]]

### F - Servants' Quarters
> This room contains four simple beds and an equal number of plain wooden trunks.
* Household staff all live here, they are:
  * A maid (LG female **commoner**)
  * A cook (LG male **commoner**)
  * The butler
  * The baroness's lady-in-waiting
* The chests here just contain the staff's clothes and uniforms

### G - Kitchen
> A cook wearing a white apron over a black smock busies himself in this warm, well-appointed kitchen. A staircase in one corner climbs to the upper floor.
* The door to the garden to the west is locked but the cook and [[Vargas Vallakovich]] have keys to it

### H - Pantry
> This pantry contains shelves of foodstuffs, although half of the shelves are bare. Two barrels of wine stand against the east wall.
* Hasn't been fully stocked for a while
* Two barrels of wine are labeled with [[The Wizard of Wines]] logo and contain Red Dragon Crush

## Areas - Upper Floor
### I - Upstairs Gallery
* Arriving from the entrance (area A): 
> The staircase climbs twenty feet to a beautifully appointed gallery that continues toward the west, running almost the length of the mansion. Framed landscape paintings line the walls, and red silk drapes cover a ten-foot-tall arched window of leaded glass.

* Arriving from the kitchen (area G):
> The staircase climbs to a ten-foot-wide gallery that stretches almost the length of the mansion. Breathtaking paintings of landscapes line the walls. Two separate, narrow hallways lead away from the gallery to the north.

### J - Izek's Bedroom
* Door is locked, [[Izek Strazni]] has the key
> Dolls. This room is full of pretty little dolls with powder-white skin and auburn hair, some of them dressed beautifully, others plainly. Some of the dolls fill a long bookshelf, and others are arranged in neat rows on wall-mounted shelves. Still others are piled atop a bed and a heavy wooden chest. What's most odd is that all of the dolls, apart from their clothing, look the same. They all look like Ireena Kolyana.

* The dolls are all made by [[Gadof Blinksy]] and have the tag "Is no fun, is no Blinksy!" on them
* [[Izek Strazni]] sleeps here at night but is usually in town doing business during the day (might be fun to do a luck roll to see if Izek happens to be walking by when the characters walk in)
* There are some empty wine bottles under the bed labeled "Purple Grapemash" with [[The Wizard of Wines]] logo on them

#### Treasure
* The chest in here is unlocked, there's a nonmagical shortsword under some clothes
  * If [[Ireena Kolyana]] is in here because she's been trapped by [[Izek Strazni]], roll a d6 for what corner of the room she's in, with 5 and 6 meaning she's actually bound. If not bound she'll have taken the sword for self defense and will attack the first person coming through to try and escape

### K - Victor's Bedroom
> This handsomely appointed room contains a canopied bed, a low bookshelf, and a full-length mirror in a wooden frame on the wall across from the door. Set into the north wall is an arched window of leaded glass. Nothing here seems unusual.

* Books are about Barovian fables, mythology, heraldry, and other subjects

### L - Library
> Floor-to-ceiling shelves line every wall of this windowless room, and the number of books contained here is nothing short of astounding.
> A brass oil lamp sits atop a large desk in the center of the room. The chair behind the desk is comfortably padded and has the symbol of a roaring bear stitched into its back cushion.

* If [[Vargas Vallakovich]] hasn't been pulled elsewhere read:
> Standing behind the chair, holding an open book, is a bear of a man. His breastplate, rapier, silk tunic, and greasy beard glisten in the lamplight. Resting on small rugs to his left and right are a pair of black mastiffs.

#### Treasure
* The desk contains parchment, jars of ink, writing quills as well as old tax records
* The books here are on just about every subject, see **module pg. 68** for random topics

### M - Locked Closet
* Baron has the key
> Chained to the back wall of this otherwise empty closet is a badly beaten man wearing nothing but a loincloth. The iron shackles have cut into his wrists, causing blood to trickle down his hands.

* Man is named [[Udo Lukovich]]
  * His manacles break if they take 10+ damage from a single weapon attack
  * If freed, [[Vargas Vallakovich]] sends [[Izek Strazni]] after Udo to find him. After being questioned he'll give the party up to him which will turn the burgomaster against them

### N - Master Bedroom Closet
> Cloaks, coats, gowns, and other fancy apparel hang from hooks in this closet. Arranged on low shelves are many fine shoes, slippers, and boots.

### O - Master Bedroom
> Time has faded the grandeur of this master bedroom. The furnishings have lost some of their color and splendor. A short pull-rope hangs from a wooden trapdoor in the ceiling.

* The pull rope opens an unfolding ladder that leads to the attic.

### P - Bridal Gown and Spirit Mirror
> This room smells of powder and fine perfume. A vanity with a mirror stands against one wall next to a faceless wooden mannequin wearing a white bridal gown. Mounted on another wall is a full-length mirror with a gilded frame. A door in one corner leads to a garderobe.

* [[Lydia Petrovna]] keeps her bridal gown here to remind her of happier times
* Using _Detect Magic_ will reveal that the mirror radiates conjuration magic. Casting _Identify_ reveals an assassin's ghost is bound to it as well as the rhyme required to summon the ghost:
> Magic mirror on the wall,
> summon forth your shade;
> night's dark vengeance, heed my call
> and wield your murderous blade
