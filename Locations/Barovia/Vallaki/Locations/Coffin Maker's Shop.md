# Coffin Maker's Shop
![[CurseofStrahd_CoffinMakersShop_DM.jpg]]
> This uninviting shop is two stories tall and has a sign shaped like a coffin above the front door. All of the window shutters are closed up tight, and a deathly silence surrounds the establishment.

* Owned by [[Henrik van der Voort]] (see more info on his situation on his page)
* The windows are latticed iron and frosted glass and are locked. The doors are  barred too.
* Henrik says the shop is closed if the characters show up but won't resist if they break in. He'll also give up where **St. Andral's Bones** (Henrik's Bedroom) are as well as the **Vampire Nest**.
* If the characters report the incident to [[Vargas Vallakovich]] he'll dispatch 4 **guards** to arrest Henrik and get the bones. Henrik will only retrieve the bones himself if it's daytime.
  * He explains that the vampires forced him to steal the bones

## A - Coffin Storage
> Arranged haphazardly about the floor of this musty, L-shaped room are 13 wooden coffins.

* [[Henrik van der Voort]] makes coffins here, all of them are empty

## B - Junk Room
> A table with four chairs is in one corner of this room, with a lantern hanging from a chain directly above. Two well-made cabinets  stand against the east wall.

The cabinets just have useless stuff Henrik has collected over the years

## C - Workshop
> This workshop contains everything a carpenter needs to make coffins and furniture. Three sturdy worktables stretch the length of the west wall.

Henrik builds coffins and keeps his tools here

## D - Kitchen
> This kitchen contains a square table surrounded by chairs and shelves of provisions

Henrik makes meals here

## E - Henrik's Bedroom
> This modest bedchamber holds a cot and several well made pieces of furniture, including a table, a padded chair, a bookshelf, and a wardrobe

* Henrik sleeps here
* The bookshelf has storybooks and carpenters' manuals

### Treasure
* The wardrobe has a secret compartment which can be found with a **DC 15 perception check** which contains 2 sacks:
  * One contains the **bones of St. Andral**
  * One contains **30 sp and 12 ep**, all of which bear the visage of Strahd

## F - Vampire Nest
> This large, drafty room is strung with cobwebs and takes up most of the upper floor. Stacks of wooden planks lie amid several crates labeled "JUNK"

* The two southmost crates are actually junk, but the six at the north end are filled with dirt and house the **vampire spawn** living there
  * Opening any occupied crate causes all the spawn to attack
* The spot marked "T" is a teleport destination from [[Castle Ravenloft]]
