# St. Andral's Church
> This slouching, centuries-old stone church has a bulging steeple in the back and walls lined with cracked, stained glass windows depicting pious saints. A fence of wrought iron encloses a garden of gravestones next to the church. A thin mist creeps among the graves.

* Use the [[Barovia Town]] church map if a map is needed.
* Dedicated to the [[Morninglord]] and named after St. Andral whose bones used to be buried here
* Father [[Lucian Petrovich]] (priest) runs the church along with an altar boy named [[Yeska]] and a gravedigger named [[Milivoj]] (commoner)
* At night the church is filled with **2d6 frightened commoners** and **2d6 frightened children** who come to hear prayers of protection from the father
  * One of the congregation is always [[Willemina Rikalova]] whose son [[Udo Lukovich]] is imprisoned by the burgomaster for speaking out against him

## Bones of St. Andral
* Someone stole St. Andral's bones from the crypt below the church so it's no longer hallowed ground and is vulnerable to [[Strahd]]
* [[Lucian Petrovich]] hasn't told anyone but [[Yeska]] about the bones a little while ago to comfort him. When asked, [[Yeska]] says he did tell someone about them but won't say a name
* [[Lucian Petrovich]] suspects it was [[Milivoj]] but hasn't told authorities because he doesn't want to ruin [[The Festival of the Blazing Sun]] or cause distress in the congregation
* The crypt is underground in the chapel, and [[Milivoj]] pried up the floorboards to get at the bones and sold them, also telling [[Hendrik van der Voort]] about them
* Finding and returning the bones makes the church hallowed ground again, effectively being under a Hallow spell permanently
