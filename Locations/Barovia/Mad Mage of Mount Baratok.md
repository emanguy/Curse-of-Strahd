# Mordenkainen
#Status/needs-foundry 

## History
* Powerful wizard, came to Barovia to fight [[Strahd]]
* Fight didn't go well for him, got thrown off the [[Tser Falls]]
* Survived but lost his staff and spellbook
* Went mad realizing he had no hope of defeating Strahd or freeing Barovia's people

## Current behavior
* Very paranoid that powerful enemies are out to kill him, assumes the party will try to kill him too so he'll try and preemptively attack them
* **If he falls below 50HP he tries to run away**
* _Greater Restoration_ would normally heal his madness but he has a _Mind Blank_ spell on him that lasts for **3d6** hours which prevents the former spell from fixing him
  * A **DC 15 Persuasion Check** can convince Mordenkainen to tell the party about the _Mind Blank_ spell
  * A **DC 18 Arcana Check** can also tell the characters why the spell failed
* When the party meets him, Mordenkainen has already expended the following spell slots on a few spells:
  * A 1st level slot to cast _Mage Armor_
  * A 4th level slot to cast _Polymorph_
  * A 7th level slot to cast _Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion_
