# Luna River Crossroads

* Check for a random encounter every time the party reaches these crossroads
> The road comes to an X intersection, with branches to the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast. The lower half of a snapped wooden signpost thrusts upward at an angle near the eastern elbow of the intersection. The top half of the sign, featuring arms pointing in four directions, lies in the weeds nearby.

  * Lake Baratok to the northwest (and [[Van Richten's Tower]])
  * [[Vallaki]] and
