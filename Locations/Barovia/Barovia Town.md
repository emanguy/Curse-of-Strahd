# Barovia Town

![[CurseofStrahd_VillageOfBarovia_DM.jpg]]

## Locations
* **E1** - Bildrath's Mercantile. Shop where the [[Vistani]] stop
* **E2** - The Blood of the Vine tavern. [[Ismark]] asks for help here to help transport [[Ireena]] to [[Vallaki]].
* **E3** - Mad Mary's Townhouse. Mad Mary cries in here that her teenage daughter ran away. The house is barricaded and boarded up.
* **E4** - The Burgomaster's Mansion. [[Ireena]] is staying here and will not open the door unless the party can prove they have no affiliation with [[Strahd]]. If the party has [[Ismark]] with them, he will get them into the mansion much easier.
  * The Burgomaster is dead in a coffin inside the mansion. [[Ireena]] will not leave until he's taken to the church cemetery to be buried
* **E5** - The Church. [[Father Donavich]] is the priest here and his son is a vampire in the basement. This is where The Burgomaster will get buried
* **E6** - The Cemetery behind the church. At night dead adventurers march to [[Castle Ravenloft]] to try and kill [[Strahd]] like they did when they were still alive. Some will stand out to the party though:
  * [[Corvyn Folker]] - Ga'ael (Goliath barbarian)
  * [[Kragg Thegrim]] - Jerry (Dragonborn Rogue)
  * [[P'ome Gnossum]] - Ben (Dragonborn Wizard)
  * [[Bam Booty]] - Ruflyn (Tiefling Wizard)
  * [[Asterion Tolger]] - Rylith (Eladrin Wizard)
* **E7** -
