# Svalich Woods
> Towering trees, whose tops are lost in heavy gray mist, block out all but a death-gray light. The tree trunks are unnaturally close to one another, and the woods have the silence of a forgotten grave, yet exude the feeling of an unvoiced scream.

## The warning letter
If the party goes into the woods, they find the corpse of [[Dalvan Olensky]].
* He was trying to put a letter on the eastern [[Gates of Barovia]] to warn newcomers to stay away from Barovia
* Killed by dire wolves on the way
* The letter he holds is from [[Kolyan Indirovich]], with a wax seal that has a "B" on it

If the characters wait in the woods too long they'll start hearing wolves. Putting them in initiative, one more wolf howls every round until the 5th round when they attack. The encounter is:
* 5 dire wolves
* 20 wolves (if the charaters are trying to leave Barovia)

### Flavor text
> You catch the smell of death in the air.

After finding Dalvan:
>  The foul scent leads you to a human corpse half-buried in the underbrush about fifteen feet from the road. The young man appears to be a commoner. His muddy clothes are torn and raked with claw marks. Crows have been at the body, which is surrounded by the paw prints. The man has obviously been dead for several days. He holds a crumpled envelope in one hand.

### Letter content
> Hail to thee of might and valor,
>
> I, the Burgomaster of Barovia, send you honor -- with despair. My adopted daughter, the fair Ireena Kolyana, has been these past nights bitten by a vampyr. For over four hundred years, this creature has drained the life blood of my people. Now, my dear Ireena languishes and dies from an unholy wound caused by this vile beast. He has become too powerful to conquer.
> So I say to you, give us up for dead and encircle this land with the symbols of good. Let holy men call upon their power that the devil may be contained within the walls of weeping Barovia. Leave our sorrows to our graves, and save the world from this evil gate of ours.
> There is much wealth entrapped in this community. Return for your reward after we are all departed for a better life.

> Kolyan Indirovich
