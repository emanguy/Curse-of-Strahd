A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill above a flimsy doorway leading to the building's interior. Perched on a wooden beam above the door is a raven. It hops about and squawks at you, seemingly agitated.

* The players can see a ring of stones (**The Megaliths**) in the forest beyond the windmill.
