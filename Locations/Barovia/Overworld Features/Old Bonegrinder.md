# Old Bonegrinder
![[CurseofStrahd_OldBonegrinder_DM.jpg]]

## Overview
* Old bonegrinder is where [[Morgantha]]'s daughters ([[Bella Sunbane]] and [[Offalia Wormwiggle]]) form her coven. Hags use coven rules here.

## Approach
> The Old Svalich Road transitions here from being a winding path through the Balinok Mountains to a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside as it descends into a fog filled valley. In the heart of the valley you see a walled town near the shores of a great mountain lake, its waters dark and still. A branch in the road leads west to a promontory, atop which is perched a dilapidated stone windmill, its warped wooden vanes stripped bare.

More Detail:
> The onion-domed edifice leans forward and to one side, as though trying to turn away from the stormy gray sky. You see gray brick walls and dirt covered windows on the upper floors. A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill above a flimsy doorway leading to the building's interior. Perched on a wooden beam above the door is a raven. It hops about and squawks at you, seemingly agitated.

* With a **DC 12** insight check, the party can determine the raven is trying to warn them of the danger inside. It flies to [[Vallaki]] after trying to warn the party.
* The players can see a ring of stones (**The Megaliths**) in the forest beyond the windmill.

## Ground Floor
> The ground floor has been converted into a makeshift kitchen, but the room is filthy. Baskets and old dishware are piled everywhere. Adding to the clutter is a peddler's cart, a chicken coop, a heavy wooden trunk, and a pretty wooden cabinet with flowers painted on its doors.. In addition to the clucking of the chickens, you hear toads croaking.
>
> The sweet smell of pastries blends horridly with a stench that burns your nostrils. The awful odor comes out of an open, upright barrel in the center of the room.
>
> Warmth issues from a brick oven against the wall, and a crumbling staircase ascends the wall across from it. Shrieks and cackles from somewhere higher up cause the old mill to shudder.

* There are small human bones on the floor
* There's an **oven** here where dream pastries are being baked (see [[Morgantha]])
  * She checks on these pastries every 10 minutes
* There's a **barrel** containing green-black demon ichor
  * Morgantha uses this for scrying
  * Can also summon a **dretch** from it by knocking on the barrel 3 times, which stays around and obeys her commands for 1 hour. **9 can be summoned at a time.**
* The **cabinet** here contains wooden bowls of herbs and baking ingredients, including gourds of powdered bone
  * On the inside of the doors there are **12 locks of hair**
  * There are also 3 containers holding elixirs labeled **youth, laughter, and mother's milk**
    * Youth = golden syrup that makes you look younger for 24 hours
    * Laughter = red tea that gives you cackle fever (see _DMG Diseases, chapter 8_)
    * Mother's milk = pale tincture (see _DMG poisons, chapter 8_)
  * There's a **chicken coop** with 3 chickens, a rooste
