## Overview
* Old bonegrinder is where [[Morgantha]]'s daughters ([[Bella Sunbane]] and [[Offalia Wormwiggle]]) form her coven. Hags use coven rules here.

## Approach
> The Old Svalich Road transitions here from being a winding path through the Balinok Mountains to a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside as it descends into a fog filled valley. In the heart of the valley you see a walled town near the shores of a great mountain lake, its waters dark and still. A branch in the road leads west to a promontory, atop which is perched a dilapidated stone windmill, its warped wooden vanes stripped bare.

More Detail:
> The oniod-domed edifice leans forward and to one side, as though trying to turn away from the stormy gray sky. You see gray brick walls and dirt covered windows on the upper floors. A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill abowve
