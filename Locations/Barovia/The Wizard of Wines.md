# The Wizard of Wines
![[CurseofStrahd_WizardofWineWinery_DM.jpg]]

## History & Current Situation
* The vineyard is the only place that grows grapes in Barovia, and it gives wine to the taverns of barovia for free
* Owned by [[Davian Martikov]] who inherited it from the [[Krezkovs]] years back
* Known for 3 types of wine
  * Purple Grapemash No. 3
  * Red Dragon Crush
  * Champagne du le Stomp
* Has 3 grapevine gems planted by a mage many years ago which allow the grapevines at the winery to thrive, all of which have been stolen
  * Unsure who stole the first one (this is left as an exercise to the reader)
  * Second was stolen by [[Baba Lysaga]] who is repeatedly attacking the winery with scarecrows
  * Third was stolen by evil druids who took the gem back to [[Yester Hill]]
* The [[Yester Hill Druids]] later attacked the winery and drove [[Davian Martikov]] and his family out and poisoned the fermentation vats so there's only a little bit of drinkable wine left

## Approaching the Vineyard

* Read when the players reach the fork of the road toward the vineyard:
> After a half mile, the road becomes a muddy trail that meanders through the woods, descending gradually until the trees part, revealing a mist-shrouded meadow. The trail splits. One branch heads west into the valley, and the other leads south into dark woods. A wooden signpost at the intersection points west and reads "Vineyard".

* Read when the players start going down the vineyard trail:
> A light drizzle begins to fall. Unpainted fences blindly follow the trail, which skirts north of a sprawling vineyard before bending south toward a stately building. The fog takes on ghostly forms as it swirls between the neatly tended rows of grapevines. Here and there, you see rope-handled half-barrels used for hauling grapes. North of the trail is a large stand of trees. A man wearing a dark cloak and cowl stands at the edge of the trees, beckoning you.

* The man beckoning is one of **9 wereravens, LG M/F base humans**

### Meeting the wereravens
* Wereravens wear dark leather raincloaks and cowls
* One is [[Davian Martikov]]
  * Doesn't tell them about stolen gems until he trusts them
    * Specifically mentions that the gems are in [[Ruins of Berez|Berez]] and [[Yester Hill]] but he doesn't know what happened to the 3rd one
    * Says they're the size and shape of pinecones and glow green as bright as a torch
  * Tells them that the evil druids have taken over the winery, getting rid of them makes him trust the party
