## History & Current Situation
* The vineyard is the only place that grows grapes in Barovia, and it gives wine to the taverns of barovia for free
* Owned by [[Davian Martikov]] who inherited it from the [[Krezkovs]] years back
* Known for 3 types of wine
  * Purple Grapemash No. 3
  * Red Dragon Crush
  * Champagne du le Stomp
* Has 3 grapevine gems planted by a mage many years ago which allow the grapevines at the winery to thrive, all of which have been stolen
  * Unsure who stole the first one
  * Second was stolen by [[Baba Lysaga]] who is repeatedly attacking the winery with scarecrows
  * Third was stolen by evil druids who took the gem back to [[Yester Hill]]
* The [[Yester Hill Druids]] later attacked the winery and drove [[Davian Martikov]] and his family out and poisoned the fermentation vats so there's only a little bit of drinkable wine left
