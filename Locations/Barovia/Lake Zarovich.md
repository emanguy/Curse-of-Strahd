# Lake Zarovich
> At the foot of a mountain, nestled in the misty forest, is a large lake. The water is perfectly still and dark, reflecting the black clouds overhead like a monstrous mirror.

Add this if they went to the lake via the shore north of [[Vallaki]]:

> Pulled up along the south shore are three small rowboats. A fourth boat can be seen in the middle of the lake, with a lone figure sitting in it, fishing pole in hand.

* Each rowboat holds **5 people**
* The boat in the middle of the lake holds [[Bluto Krogarov]] who has [[Arabelle]]
  * The boat is 400 feet from shore and can be reached before Arabelle is pushed in by swimming for a **DC 15 Athletics Check** or by taking a boat for a **DC 10 Athletics Check**.
    * If the characters watch him for a little bit he tosses Arabelle in
  * Bluto is in a trance and doesn't respond to anything unless attacked
  * Arabelle is tied up with hempen rope and is in a burlap sack. She's lying down and can't be seen from shore
