# Haunted House

![[CurseofStrahd_DeathHouse_DM.jpg]]

# Overview
The wealthy family that used to live here performed the dark arts here. They are the [[Strahd Cult]]. They used to try to summon extraplanar entities to no avail and involved innocents in their rituals. When [[Strahd]] came on the scene, they thought it was an omen but made a mistake when they sacrificed a group of adventurers Strahd brought into barovia to play with. He murdered them all and they now haunt the house.
