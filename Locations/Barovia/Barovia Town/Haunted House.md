# Haunted House

![[CurseofStrahd_DeathHouse_DM.jpg]]

# Overview
The wealthy family that used to live here (the **Durst** family) performed the dark arts here. They are the [[Strahd Cult]]. They used to try to summon extraplanar entities to no avail and involved innocents in their rituals. When [[Strahd]] came on the scene, they thought it was an omen but made a mistake when they sacrificed a group of adventurers Strahd brought into barovia to play with. He murdered them all and they now haunt the house.

# Rose and Thorn
Rose and Thorn are illusions created by the house who try to lure the characters inside the house. They think there are monsters in the basement but it's actually the screams of the Strahd cult murdering victims. They know the following info:
* They don't know what the monster looks like
* Their parents keep the monster locked in the basement
* There's a baby in the third floor nursery
* They saw [[Asterion Tolger]] and [[Asterion's Master]] enter the house once before

You are but worms writhing in my earth.

  * Exact dimensions can be found on **page 220**
  * The cult would hang people from the shackles and gut them to spill their blood on the altar

## Approaching the Altar
* When the characters get near the altar 13 apparitions appear on the raised areas which start chanting their chant (He is the Ancient/He is the Land)
  * Their faces are voids and are holding torches that suck in light
  * They cannot be dispelled or really even be affected by magic
* When the party gets even closer they start chanting "One must die! One must die!" because they want a sacrifice
  * If the players aren't sure what to do they can make a **DC 11 Religion check** to determine what the cultists mean
* If the players sacrifice something Strahd is aware of it and the house lets them go
* If the players walk away from the altar the cultists start chanting "Lorghoth the Decayer, we awaken thee!" and the **shambling mound** awakens and fights the party
* Trigger for [[Asterion's Master]]
