# Haunted House

![[CurseofStrahd_DeathHouse_DM.jpg]]

# Overview
The wealthy family that used to live here (the **Durst** family) performed the dark arts here. They are the [[Strahd Cult]]. They used to try to summon extraplanar entities to no avail and involved innocents in their rituals. When [[Strahd]] came on the scene, they thought it was an omen but made a mistake when they sacrificed a group of adventurers Strahd brought into barovia to play with. He murdered them all and they now haunt the house.

# Rose and Thorn
Rose and Thorn are illusions created by the house who try to lure the characters inside the house. They think there are monsters in the basement but it's actually the screams of the Strahd cult murdering victims. They know the following info:
* They don't know what the monster looks like
* Their parents keep the monster locked in the basement
* There's a baby in the third floor nursery
* They saw [[Asterion Tolger]] and [[Asterion's Master]] enter the house once before

However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not he ones who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but worms writhing in my earth.
  >     
  > You say that you are cursed, your fortunes spent. You abandoned love for madness, took solace in the bosom of another woman, and sired a stillborn son. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have to doubt. Save you from four wrecthedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.
