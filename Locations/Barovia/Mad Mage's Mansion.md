# Mad Mage's Mansion
> North of the mountain lake, the trees begin their steady climb up the slopes of Mount Baratok, its monolithic presence oppressive at this distance. The ground here is rocky, uneven, and tiring to navigate. Even the wolves avoid this neck of the woods. Soon, you climb above the blanket of fog that engulfs the valley. Dark thunderclouds roll overhead.
> You see an elk standing on a rocky spur about sixty feet away. Suddenly, it assumes the form of a man in tattered black robes. His hair and beard are long, black, and streaked with gray, and his eyes crackle with eldritch power.

* The [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok]] lives in the woods here
* If the characters cure the mage of his madness he takes them to an invisible doorway that leads to his casting of _Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion_
  * If the characters mention they're from the Forgotten Realms he'll ask them if they know his old friend Elminster of Shadowdale
  * He then sets off on his own to find his spellbook and staff. He doesn't allow the party to assist him because he thinks they'll try to steal those items for themselves
