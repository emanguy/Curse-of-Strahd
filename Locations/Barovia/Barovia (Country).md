# The Land of Barovia
![[CurseofStrahd_LandOfBarovia_DM.jpg]]

Surrounded by impassable fog. Only the [[Vistani]] can go back and forth. Always cloudy or storming. Normal populous is the [[Barovians]].

**It should be noted that due to [[Strahd]]'s curse it's always cloudy so he can walk about without being affected by sunlight.**

Random encounter tables for the overworld can be found on **page 28**
