# Session Notes - 2022-01-22
* Party went to a blacksmith so [[Corvyn Folker]] can get some silver wire from the silverware he stole from [[Daggerford]]
* Visited a Tanner at the edge of town to get [[P'ome Gnossum]] some leather armor but the place was trashed. The tanner said she could get it fixed by the evening

## Reminders for next session
* [ ] If [[Corvyn Folker]] removes the silverware from the grounds it will get ruined
  * [ ] Same thing with the normal books but the scrolls just age
* [ ] [[P'ome Gnossum]] needs to pick up his leather armor
