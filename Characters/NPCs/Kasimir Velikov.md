# Kasimir Velikov

* Took the name of the Vistani who allowed him into their camp initially
  * Thinks the current [[Vistani]] aren't as noble or enlightened as their forebears
  * Will just outlive them to go back to the old ways
* Sister ([[Patrina Velikovna]]) is sealed in the catacombs below [[Castle Ravenloft]]
  * Stoned her to death with the other [[Dusk Elves]] because he thought she was [[Strahd]]'s concubine
  * All the women of his tribe were slaughtered by Strahd as a result, plus Strahd cut off his ears
    * Wears a cowl to hide the mutilation
  * Wants to get back at Strahd as a result, and frequently sees his sister in his dreams
* [[Patrina Velikovna]] came to him in a dream and told him [[The Amber Temple]] is where [[Strahd]] formed his contract with evil forces to become a vampire.
  * Needs adventurers' help to survive getting through it
  * Thinks it might hold the secret to defeating [[Strahd]]
  * Thinks it might also have something to bring the dead back to life which he wants to use on his dead sister
    * He's being used by [[Patrina Velikovna]] to be brought back to life. (see her page for more info)
