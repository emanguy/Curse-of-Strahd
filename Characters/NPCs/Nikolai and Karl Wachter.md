# Nikolai and Karl Wachter
* Not home during the day, may be encountered at the [[Blue Water Inn]] because they can't stand their mom's rambling
* Get home late at night drunk off their asses
* Aware of [[Lady Fiona Wachter]]'s cult but don't care about it
* Unaware that [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] sleeps at night with [[Nikolai Wachter Sr.]]. Finding out may make them turn against her
* Just want to spend [[Lady Fiona Wachter]]'s money and party away their miserable lives
* Drugs from [[P'ome Gnossum]]
  * Unicorn dust - Coke, makes them think they have a horn instead of a nose
  * Pixie Stix - Hallucinogenics/shrooms
  * Wyrmweed - makes a smoke trail out of your nose, warm bubbly mood, gives you temporary scales
