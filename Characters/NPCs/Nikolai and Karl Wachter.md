# Nikolai and Karl Wachter
* Not home during the day, may be encountered at the [[Blue Water Inn]] because they can't stand their mom's rambling
* Get home late at night drunk off their asses
* Aware of [[Lady Fiona Wachter]]'s cult but don't care about it
* Unaware that [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] sleeps at night with [[Nikolai Wachter Sr.]]
