# Stella Wachter
* Got mentally fucked up by [[Victor Vallakovich]], the Burgomaster's son because he was so unkind to her
* A **Greater Restoration** spell can rid her of her madness that makes her think she's a cat
* Blames [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] for treating her horribly and using her as a pawn to seize control of the town
* Doesn't know any of [[Lady Fiona Wachter]]'s secrets other than the fact that she wants to overthrow [[Vargas Vallakovich]]
* Has nothing good to say about either [[Victor Vallakovich]] or [[Vargas Vallakovich]], the former makes her cringe
* Latches onto any character that is kind to her. If she's taken to [[St. Andral's Church]], [[Lucian Petrovich]] says he can take care of her and she'll stay with him
