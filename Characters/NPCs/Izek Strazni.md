# Izek Strazni
* Izek and [[Ireena Kolyana]] were born in Vallaki (he thinks, due to [[My Love, the Mayor's Daughter]])
* Born without a soul, unlike his sister

## History
* Izek's father and uncle took him and [[Ireena Kolyana]] fishing on [[Lake Zarovich]]
* On the way back, a dire wolf attacked him and bit off his right arm
* His father carried him back to town while the uncle distracted the beast, but his sister ran off into the woods, never to be seen again
* Eventually forgot about his sister and learned to live with his disability
* His parents succumbed to grief, leaving him orphaned
* Became a sociopath, other kids bullied him for being a one armed orphan but he killed them and disposed of their bodies
* Brought to [[Vargas Vallakovich]] who didn't punish him but made him work for him instead

## Fiendish Arm
* Woke up one morning to find that he grew a new arm with barbed spines, elongated fingers, and long nails
* Can snap his fingers to create fire

## Longing for Ireena
* Collects dolls that he forces [[Gadof Blinksy]] to make for him because he has dreams about [[Ireena Kolyana]]
* If he spots [[Ireena Kolyana]] he tries to take her by force to the [[Burgomaster's Mansion (Vallaki)]] and keeps her prisoner in his bedroom
