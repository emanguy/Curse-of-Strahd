# Bam's Parents

* **Slam Booty** and **Jam Booty**

## Recent Activity
* Currently hired by the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] for a "peacekeeping" operation
* Ambushed at [[Old Bonegrinder]] by the [[Dusk Elf Slavers]], got badly poisoned
* [[Urwin Martikov]] took them in after they managed to stumble into the [[Blue Water Inn]] and offered to let them become wereravens because the transformation would make them immune to the poison
* Sent on a mission to spy on the [[Dusk Elf Slavers]] but were captured a few weeks ago
  * They're in raven form so they can't transform

## Letting Bam Go
* The two are part of an ancient monastic order called **Hintern** who are sworn to defend the people of Waterdeep
* About a year after Jam had Bam, Waterdeep was attacked and suffered bad losses and Hintern was called upon to strike back against the attackers
* Jam had no choice but to leave Bam somewhere because she couldn't bring him into a war zone
* They fought in this war for about 7 years. When they returned they felt so ashamed that they had abandoned Bam they decided they couldn't face him and never came back for him
