* Lawful good human Veteran
* Villagers call him **Ismark the Lesser** since he lived in his father's shadow
* The son of the Burgomaster
* Pretty tight lipped unless talking about [[Ireena Kolyana]] or [[Strahd]]
* Knows everything [[Barovians]] know
* Spent his adult life doing weapons training in hopes of being able to confront and kill [[Strahd]]
