# Ireena
* Human Woman with Auburn Hair
* Bitten twice by [[Strahd]]
* Has a strong will and will help the party however she can
* Not many memories and doesn't remember interactions with [[Strahd]] due to vampiric charm
  * She does remember his eyes looking real hungry
 * Turns out she's actually [[Rogue]]'s romantic interest, the Mayor's Daughter
   * When she was sent to live with her aunt, the [[Vallaki]] stole her during the night, and she remembers them casting some sort of magic spell
   * Everyone now thinks she's a woman named Ireena and she's scared out of her mind because [[Strahd]] is pursuing her due to her looking like [[Tatyana]]
