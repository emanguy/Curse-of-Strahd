# Rudolph van Richten

* Disguised as **Rictavio**, a half-elf bard
  * Claims to be a carnival ringmaster from a distant land
  * Admits to having no musical talent but still tries to entertain locals with his stories
* Has been staying at the [[Blue Water Inn]] for about a month now
* Has a pet monkey named [[Piccolo]] who is staying with [[Gadof Blinksy]]
* Has a horse named [[Drusilla]]
* Has a captured saber-tooth tiger
* If he finds out the [[Vistani]] at the [[Vistani Camp (Vallaki)]] are in league with [[Strahd]] he tries to unleash his saber-tooth tiger on them
* He's been cursed by a [[Vistani]] seer, which brings doom upon people he befriends

## History
* Came from a land called [[Darkon]]
* Married childhood sweetheart [[Ingrid]] and had a son, [[Erasmus]]
  * [[Erasmus]] was stolen by [[Vistani]] when he was 14 and was sold to a vampire named [[Baron Metus]] to be used as a companion
* Found [[Erasmus]] as a Vampire Spawn, who begged him to end his suffering, so van Richten killed him with a wooden stake
* [[Baron Metus]] then killed [[Ingrid]] as revenge for [[Erasmus]]
* With this, van Richten took up a life fighting monsters

## Hunting Strahd
* Waiting for an opportunity to attack [[Strahd]] but knows he can't win on a full on fight.
  * Waiting until he goes to sleep in his coffin
* In the meantime, hides in plain sight with a _Hat of Disguise_ and protects his thoughts with a _Ring of Mind Shielding_
* Trying to learn more about the [[Keepers of the Feather]] to gain a potential ally in the future
* Wants to take out [[Strahd]]'s allies, starting with the Vistani
* Unaware that [[Esmerelda d'Avenir]], his former Protege, is roaming around Barovia looking for him
  * If he hears about her, he tries to protect her as best he can without putting his plans in jeopardy
