# Vallakians
* Know everything [[Barovians]] do

## General Knowledge
* The [[Blue Water Inn]] offers food, wine, and shelter to visitors. A stranger with pointed ears is staying there who came into town on a carnival wagon
* The burgomaster [[Vargas Vallakovich]] is holding [[The Festival of the Blazing Sun]] in 3 days. The previous festival, the [[Wolf's Head Jamboree]] happened less than a week ago.
* [[Vallaki]] has had at least one festival a week for the past several years. Some vallakians think the festivals keep [[Strahd]] at bay and some think they have no effect. Most think they're dismal
* Anyone who speak badly of the festivals are declared by [[Vargas Vallakovich]] to be in league with [[Strahd]]. Some are thrown in the stocks while others are taken to the [[Burgomaster's Mansion (Vallaki)]] to be purged of their evil.
* [[Vargas Vallakovich]]'s henchman [[Izek Strazni]] has a history of violence and a deformity - a monstrous arm that conjures fire. He keeps the baron's enemies at bay
* [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] hates the burgomaster, saying "I'd rather serve the devil than a madman". 
  * She has an old house in town but doesn't leave often. Her sons [[Nikolai Wachter]] and [[Karl Wachter]] are troublemakers
  * She has a mad daughter she keeps locked away
  * [[Vargas Vallakovich]] doesn't mess with her because she has old ties to Strahd
* Purple flashes have been seen coming from the attic of [[Vargas Vallakovich]]'s mansion
* Wolves and dire wolves prowl the woods and aren't afraid to attack travelers of the Old Svalich Road. Hunters and Trappers managed to kill several but more keep coming
* It's too dangerous to go fishing on [[Lake Zarovich]] but [[Strahd]]'s wolves haven
