# Vallakians
* Know everything [[Barovians]] do

## General Knowledge
* The [[Blue Water Inn]] offers food, wine, and shelter to visitors. A stranger with pointed ears is staying there who came into town on a carnival wagon
* The burgomaster [[Vargas Vallakovich]] is holding [[The Festival of the Blazing Sun]] in 3 days. The previous festival, the [[Wolf's Head Jamboree]] happened less than a week ago.
* [[Vallaki]] has had at least one festival a week for the past several years. Some vallakians think the festivals keep [[Strahd]] at bay and some think they have no effect. Most think they're dismal
* Anyone who speak badly of the festivals are declared by [[Vargas Vallakovich]] to be in league with [[Strahd]]. Some are thrown in the stocks while others are taken to the [[Burgomaster's Mansion (Vallaki)]]
