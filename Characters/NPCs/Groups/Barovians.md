# Barovians

* Creepy, staring, quiet, and have short tempers
* Some are born without souls. People who die are reincarnated as newborns and look the same.
  * This is why [[Ireena Kolyana]] looks like [[Strahd]]'s former lover
* Mostly human, kinda racist. They call other races "creatures"
* See **page 26** for what they know about the world.
