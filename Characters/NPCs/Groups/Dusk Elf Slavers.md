# Dusk Elf Slavers

* An offshoot of the Dusk Elves that can be found in the [[Vistani Camp (Vallaki)]]
* Because they can no longer increase their numbers and still harbor a massive grudge against [[Strahd]], they think the only way to get back at him is to capture a large group of creatures, enslave them, then march their army on [[Castle Ravenloft]] because having strength in numbers might be the only way to kill the dark lord
  * Of course, as they are already ostracized by the [[Barovians]] there's not really a way for them to get willing participants for their army
* Their next move is going to be to search [[The Amber Temple]] because it may contain an artifact they can use to better maintain control of their **Army of the Unwilling**
* They frequently have runaways because there aren't enough of them to actively keep watch over all the things they've captured
