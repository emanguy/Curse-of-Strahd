# Madam Eva
* Travels with the [[Vistani]] but isn't one of them
* Looks like she's in her 70s but is much older
* Is [[Strahd]]'s half-sister. [[King Barov]] slept with another woman during his crusades and sired her. Her real name is **Katarina**
* Worked as a maid in [[Castle Ravenloft]] and was present for the wedding of [[Sergei]] and [[Tatyana]]
* Ran away when [[Strahd]] murdered [[Sergei]] and shacked up with the [[Vistani]]
* Made a pact with [[Mother Night]] to trade her youth for the power to undo the damage [[Strahd]] caused to the land of Barovia
  * Has the gift of Magical Foresight, uses this power to send the [[Vistani]] out to other worlds to find adventurers who can break Strahd's curse
  * Taught [[Lady Jairam]] and sent her to [[Daggerford]]
 * The powers granting [[Strahd]] his power think Madam Eva could be a good successor but she has all the power she wants
   * Instead tries to help him find a successor but he doesn't know her true motive
