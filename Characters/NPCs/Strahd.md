# Strahd von Zarovich
* Had a father named **King Barov** and a brother named **Sergei**
* He was a warmonger who tired of peace and made a pact with Shadowfell to achieve immortality
* Had many wars and then instructed his subjects to build a castle which he named [[Castle Ravenloft]] after his mother, **Queen Ravenovia**. Ravenovia died on the road to Ravenloft and Strahd buried her in the crypts beneath the castle
* Fell in love with a Barovian woman named **Tatyana** who ended up falling in love with Sergei instead
* Strahd left the two of them alone until their wedding day when he decided to kill Sergei and drink his blood which sealed the pact with Shadowfell, turning him into a vampire
* Tatyana ran away from Strahd and threw herself off a balcony of Ravenloft where she fell to her death
* When the pact was completed, Barovia got trapped in a demiplane and was surrounded by the deadly mists
* Strahd now tries to search for a successor and brings adventurers into Barovia as playthings and potential successors
