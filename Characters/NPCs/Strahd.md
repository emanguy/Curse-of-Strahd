# Strahd von Zarovich
* Had a father named [[King Barov]] and a brother named [[Sergei]]
* He was a warmonger who tired of peace and made a pact with Shadowfell to achieve immortality
* Had many wars and then instructed his subjects to build a castle which he named [[Castle Ravenloft]] after his mother, **Queen Ravenovia**. Ravenovia died on the road to Ravenloft and Strahd buried her in the crypts beneath the castle
* Fell in love with a Barovian woman named [[Tatyana]] who ended up falling in love with Sergei instead
* Strahd left the two of them alone until their wedding day when he decided to kill Sergei and drink his blood which sealed the pact with Shadowfell, turning him into a vampire
* [[Tatyana]] ran away from Strahd and threw herself off a balcony of Ravenloft where she fell to her death
* When the pact was completed, Barovia got trapped in a demiplane and was surrounded by the deadly mists
* Strahd now tries to search for a successor and brings adventurers into Barovia as playthings and potential successors

## Goals
1. Turn [[Ireena]] - Ireena looks exactly like Tatyana. Strahd has visited her twice now and the previous time he drank her blood.
2. Find [[Rudolph van Richten]] - Van Richten is a famous vampire hunter. Strahd wants to capture him and torture him in his dungeons.
3. Search for a successor or consort - When new people enter Barovia Strahd will try to determine if any of them are worthy successors or consorts. He especially likes fighting people who exhibit great fortitude or defiance

## Roleplay Tips
* Strahd has very few emotions left, so trying to appeal to his humanity won't work
* He can be seductive and charming
* He tries to drive a wedge in the party if possible, trying to sway PCs to his side and trying to turn them into vampire spawn
