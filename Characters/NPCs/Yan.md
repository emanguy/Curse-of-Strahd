# Yan
* Vistani head preserved with oils which preserve it and allow it to remember things that were asked of it when casting [[speak-with-dead|Speak With Dead]]
* Banished from his clan for stealing
* Doesn't know where his body is
## Involvement with van Richten
* Met up with [[Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] who offered a ride in his carnival wagon
* Traveled together for several days but it became tense as Yan realized Rictavio wanted to find a road to Barovia
* Tried to steal Rictavio's wagon and pet monkey but Rictavio caught him and stabbed him through the chest
* Rictavio cast Speak with Dead on Yan twice to ask questions about the [[Vistani]]
* Believes Rictavio is planning to cause harm to the Vistani and begs the characters to warn his people
