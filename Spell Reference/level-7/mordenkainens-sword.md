## Description
You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range.
It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a Melee Spell Attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword.
On a hit, the target takes `3d10` force damage.
Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.
