## Description
You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear.
Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d8` damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.
