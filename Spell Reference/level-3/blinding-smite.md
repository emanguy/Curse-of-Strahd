## Description
The next time you hit a creature with a Melee Weapon Attack during this spell's duration, your weapon flares with bright light, and the attack deals an extra `3d8` radiant damage to the target.
Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or be **blinded** until the spell ends.

A creature **blinded** by this spell makes another Constitution Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a successful save, it is no longer **blinded**.
