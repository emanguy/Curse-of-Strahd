## Description
Choose a point you can see on the ground within range.
A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point.
Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d12` bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared.
Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d12` for each slot level above 3rd.
