## Description
Choose a willing creature that you can see within range.
Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a `+2` bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns.
That action can be used only to take the *attack* (one Weapon Attack only), *dash*, *disengage*, *hide*, or *use an object* action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
