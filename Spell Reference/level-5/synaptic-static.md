## Description
You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there.
Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence Saving Throw.
A creature with an Intelligence Score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell.
A target takes `8d6` psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute.
During that time, it rolls a `d6` and subtracts the number rolled from all its Attack Rolls and Ability Checks, as well as its Constitution Saving Throws to maintain **concentration**.
The target can make an Intelligence Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
