## Description
Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range.
The target must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
It takes `8d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
On a failed save, the target also burns for the spell's duration.
The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the Saving Throw.
It takes `4d6` fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one.
These magical flames can't be extinguished by nonmagical means.

If damage from this spell kills a target, the target is turned to ash.
