## Description
A swirling mass of 5-foot-deep water appears in a 30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within range.
The point must be on the ground or in a body of water.
Until the spell ends, that area is difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or take `6d6` bludgeoning damage and be pulled 10 feet toward the center.
