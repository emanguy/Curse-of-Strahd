## Description
Your touch inflicts disease.
Make a Melee Spell Attack against a creature within your reach.
On a hit, the target is **poisoned**.

At the end of each of the **poisoned** target's turns, the target must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer **poisoned**, and the spell ends.
If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer **poisoned**, but choose one of the diseases below.
The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell's duration.

Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.
