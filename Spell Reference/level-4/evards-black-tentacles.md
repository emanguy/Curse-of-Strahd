## Description
Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range.
For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or take `3d6` bludgeoning damage and be **restrained** by the tentacles until the spell ends.
A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already **restrained** by the tentacles takes `3d6` bludgeoning damage.

A creature **restrained** by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity Check (its choice) against your Spell Save DC.
On a success, it frees itself.
