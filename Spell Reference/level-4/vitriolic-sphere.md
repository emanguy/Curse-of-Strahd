## Description
You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere.
Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `10d4` acid damage and another `5d4` acid damage at the end of its next turn.
On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by `2d4` for each slot level above 4th.
