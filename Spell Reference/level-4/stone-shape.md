## Description
You touch a stone object of *medium* size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose.
So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick.
You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut.
The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.
