## Description
Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it.
The target must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
The target takes `8d8` necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the Saving Throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a Saving Throw, it simply withers and dies.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 4th.
