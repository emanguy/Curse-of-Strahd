The next time you hit a creature with a Melee Weapon Attack during this spell's duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra `4d6` psychic damage to the target.
The target must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, it has disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Ability Checks, and can't take reactions, until the end of its next turn.
