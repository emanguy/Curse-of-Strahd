## Description
You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people.
Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma Saving Throw; a creature can choose to fail this Saving Throw if it wishes.
If a creature fails its Saving Throw, choose one of the following two effects.

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be **charmed** or **frightened**.
When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward.
This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed.
When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.
