## Description
You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range.
A *medium* hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it.
The target must make a Strength Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the target takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage and is **restrained** for the spell's duration.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the **restrained** target, which must make a Strength Saving Throw.
The target takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the **restrained** target can use its action to make a Strength Check against your Spell Save DC.
On a success, the target escapes and is no longer **restrained** by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range.
The hand releases a **restrained** target if you do either.
