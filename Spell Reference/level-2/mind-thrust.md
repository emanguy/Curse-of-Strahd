## Description
You propel a lance of psionic disruption into the mind of one creature you can see within range.
The target must make an Intelligence Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the target takes `3d6` psychic damage, and it can use its action only to *dash* or *disengage* on its next turn.
On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and this spell doesn't limit its action options.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
