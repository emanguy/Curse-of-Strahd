## Description
You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment.
The target must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or take `1d8` necrotic damage.
If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes `1d12` necrotic damage.

The spell's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (`2d8` or `2d12`), 11th level (`3d8` or `3d12`), and 17th level (`4d8` or `4d12`).
