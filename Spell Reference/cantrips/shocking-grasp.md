## Description
Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch.
Make a Melee Spell Attack against the target.
You have advantage on the Attack Roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal.
On a hit, the target takes `1d8` lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by `1d8` when you reach 5th level (`2d8`), 11th level (`3d8`), and 17th level (`4d8`).
