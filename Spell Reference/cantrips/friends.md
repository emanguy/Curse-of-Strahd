## Description
For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma Checks directed at one creature of your choice that isn't hostile toward you.

A creature **prone** to violence might attack you.
Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the DM's discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.
