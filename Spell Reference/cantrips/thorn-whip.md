## Description
You create a long, vine-like whip covered in thorns that lashes out at your command toward a creature in range.
Make a Melee Spell Attack against the target.
If the attack hits, the creature takes `1d6` piercing damage, and if the creature is *large* or smaller, you pull the creature up to 10 feet closer to you.

This spell's damage increases by `1d6` when you reach 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
