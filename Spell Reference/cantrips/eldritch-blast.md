## Description
A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range.
Make a Ranged Spell Attack against the target.
On a hit, the target takes `1d10` force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level.
You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones.
Make a separate Attack Roll for each beam.
