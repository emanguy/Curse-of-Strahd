## Description
Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them.
Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature becomes **frightened** for the duration.
The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat.
At the end of each of the **frightened** creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or take `4d10` psychic damage.
On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
