## Description
You cause a tremor in the ground within range.
Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage and is knocked **prone**.
If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
