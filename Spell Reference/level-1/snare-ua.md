## Description
While you cast this spell, you use the cord or rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on a flat surface within your reach.
When you finish casting, the cord or rope disappears to become a magical trap.

The trap is nearly **invisible** and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your Spell Save DC to be found.
The trap triggers when a *small* creature or larger moves into the area protected by the spell.

The triggering creature must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or fall **prone** and be hoisted into the air until it hangs upside down 3 feet above the protected surface, where it is **restrained**.

The **restrained** creature can make a Dexterity Saving Throw with disadvantage at the end of each of its turns and ends the **restrained** effect on a success.
Alternatively, another creature that can reach the **restrained** creature can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your Spell Save DC.
On a success, the **restrained** effect also ends.
