## Description
A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand.
Roll `6d10`; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect.
Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring **unconscious** creatures and creatures that can't see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is **blinded** until the end of your next turn.
Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points.
A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional `2d10` for each slot level above 1st.
