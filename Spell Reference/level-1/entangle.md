## Description
Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range.
For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or be **restrained** by the entangling plants until the spell ends.
A creature **restrained** by the plants can use its action to make a Strength Check against your Spell Save DC.
On a success, it frees itself.

When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
