## Description
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor.
When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

This trap is nearly **invisible**, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your Spell Save DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a *small*, *medium*, or *large* creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell's radius.
That creature must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor.
The creature is **restrained** there until the spell ends.

A **restrained** creature can make a Dexterity Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your Spell Save DC.
On a success, the **restrained** effect ends.

After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is **restrained** by it.
