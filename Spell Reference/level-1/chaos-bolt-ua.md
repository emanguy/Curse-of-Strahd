## Description
You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range.
Make a Ranged Spell Attack against the target.
On a hit, the target takes `2d8` damage.
Choose one of the `d8`s.
The number it rolled determines the type of damage, as shown below.

#### Chaos Bolt
| `d8` | Damage Type |
|-----|-----|
| 1 | Acid |
| 2 | Cold |
| 3 | Fire |
| 4 | Force |
| 5 | Lightning |
| 6 | Poison |
| 7 | Psychic |
| 8 | Thunder |

If you roll the same number on both `d8`s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it.
Make a new Attack Roll against the new target, and make a new Damage Roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.
A creature can be targeted only once by this mass of chaotic energy.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes extra damage of the type rolled.
The extra damage equals `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
