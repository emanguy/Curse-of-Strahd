## Description
Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a 30-foot radius around you.
Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on all Saving Throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on Attack Rolls against them until the spell ends.
In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an affected creature with a Melee Attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light.
The attacker must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or be **blinded** until the spell ends.
