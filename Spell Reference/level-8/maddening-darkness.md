## Description
Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends.
The darkness spreads around corners.
A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness.
Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.

Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere.
Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom Saving Throw, taking `8d8` psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
