## Description
Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range.
Each creature in that light must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `12d6` radiant damage and is **blinded** for 1 minute.
On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't **blinded** by this spell.
Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this Saving Throw.

A creature **blinded** by this spell makes another Constitution Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a successful save, it is no longer **blinded**.

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
